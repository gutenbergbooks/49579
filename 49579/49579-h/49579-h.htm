Vorwort zur ersten Auflage.
</h2>

<p>
Bei der Bearbeitung des vorliegenden Auszugs aus
<span class="gesperrt">Burnetts</span><a href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a> fesselndem Romane für die Schule, lag
mir nach den Grundsätzen der Französischen und Englischen
Schulbibliothek zunächst die Aufgabe ob, denselben
so zu kürzen, daß der Inhalt des Bändchens in
einem Semester bewältigt werden kann. Es wurden
deshalb alle für die Entwicklung der Erzählung nicht
unbedingt nötigen Teile ausgeschieden, der übrige Text
aber noch soweit gekürzt, als es die Rücksicht auf die
Klarheit der Schilderung und die Korrektheit des Ausdrucks
zuließ. Dadurch ist es mir gelungen, das Ganze
auf etwa ein Dritteil des ursprünglichen Umfanges zu
beschränken, ohne jedoch den Zusammenhang zu stören
und die feine Zeichnung der Charaktere der Hauptpersonen
zu verwischen. Nur an einer Stelle war eine
etwas gewaltsame Verschmelzung mehrerer Seiten in
wenige Zeilen (<a href="#pl-82-30">S. 82, Z. 30-36</a>) nicht zu umgehen; aber
auch da erwies sich gewissenhafte Wahrung der von
Burnett selbst gebrauchten Ausdrucksweise als möglich.
</p>

<p>
Sachliche Anmerkungen brauchten nur in beschränktem
Maße gegeben zu werden, dagegen hielt
ich es für angezeigt, mit den Fußnoten nicht allzu
sparsam zu sein, einmal weil verschiedene Amerikanismen
(store, boss, ranch u. a.), sowie eine große Anzahl
vulgärer oder familiärer Ausdrücke eine Erklärung erheischten,
sodann weil gar manche Stelle des Textes
<a id="page-VI" class="pagenum" title="VI"></a>
für die Übersetzung in gutes Deutsch nicht ohne
Schwierigkeit ist. Häufiger in der Umgangssprache
erscheinende Kürzungen, wie: I&rsquo;d, he&rsquo;d, I&rsquo;ll, <a id="corr-1"></a>he&rsquo;ll u. a.,
die in den meisten Grammatiken angeführt sind, wurden
als bekannt vorausgesetzt. Bei dem S. 83 vollständig
abgedruckten Briefe Cedrics unterblieb der Raumersparnis
halber die Wiedergabe in korrektes Englisch,
soweit nicht die Rücksicht auf das Verständnis es verlangte.
</p>

<p>
Möge dieses Bändchen, das für die mittleren Klassen
aller Anstalten eine anregende Lektüre bieten wird,
die freundliche Aufnahme finden, die dem kleinen Helden
der Erzählung in der Alten wie in der Neuen
Welt zu teil geworden ist.

<p>
Die günstige Aufnahme, welche diese Ausgabe des <span class="gesperrt">Little
Lord</span> bei den Herren Fachgenossen und bei der Kritik gefunden,
hat schon nach Verlauf von nicht ganz zwei Jahren eine neue Auflage
nötig gemacht. In dieser ist der Text mit Ausnahme einer
einzigen Stelle (<a href="#pl-79-14">S. 79, Z. 14</a>), wo ich sinnrichtiger <em>a</em> statt <em>any</em>
setzte, unverändert geblieben; die früheren Fußnoten sind nach
der Vorschrift der Redaktion mit den sachlichen Anmerkungen
verbunden, letztere einer genauen Durchsicht unterzogen und um
einige vermehrt worden.

LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY.

<h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-2-1">
CHAPTER I.<br />
A GREAT SURPRISE.
</h3>

<p>
Cedric himself knew nothing whatever about it.
It had never been even mentioned to him. He knew
that his papa had been an Englishman, because his
mamma had told him so; but then his papa had died
when he was so little a boy that he could not remember
very much about him, except that he was
big, and had blue eyes and a long moustache, and
that it was a splendid thing to be carried around the
room on his shoulder. Since his papa&rsquo;s death, Cedric
had found out that it was best not to talk to his
mamma about him. When his father was ill, Cedric
had been sent away, and when he had returned, everything
was over; and his mother, who had been very
ill, too, was only just beginning to sit in her chair
by the window. She was pale and thin, and all the
dimples had gone from her pretty face, and her eyes
looked large and mournful, and she was dressed in
black.
</p>

<p>
He and his mamma knew very few people, and
lived what might have been thought very lonely lives,
although Cedric did not know it was lonely until he
grew older and heard why it was they had no visitors.
Then he was told that his mamma was an orphan,
and quite alone in the world when his papa had
married her. Their marriage brought them the ill-will
<a id="page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
of several persons. The one who was most angry of
all, however, was the Captain&rsquo;s father, who lived in
England, and was a very rich and important old nobleman,
with a very bad temper, and a very violent
dislike to America and Americans. He had two sons
older than Captain Cedric; and it was the law that
the elder of these sons should inherit the family title
and estates, which were very rich and splendid; if
the eldest son died the next one would be heir; so
though he was a member of such a great family, there
was little chance that Captain Cedric would be very
rich himself.
</p>

<p>
But it so happened that Nature had given to the
younger son gifts which she had not bestowed upon
his elder brothers. He had a beautiful face and a fine,
strong, graceful figure; he had a bright smile and a
sweet, gay voice; he was brave and generous, and
had the kindest heart in the world, and seemed to
have the power to make every one love him. But it
was not so with his elder brothers; neither of them
was handsome, or kind, or clever; they cared nothing
for study, and wasted both time and money, and made
few real friends. The old Earl, their father, was constantly
disappointed and humiliated by them; his heir
was no honour to his noble name. It was very bitter,
the old Earl thought, that the son who was only third,
should be the one who had all the gifts, and all the
charms. Sometimes he almost hated the handsome
young man because he seemed to have the good things
which should have gone with the stately title and the
magnificent estates. It was in one of his <a id="anote-2-31" href="#note-2-31">fits of petulance</a>
that he sent him off to travel in America.
</p>

<p>
But after about six months, he began to feel
lonely, and longed in secret to see his son again, so
he wrote to Captain Cedric and ordered him home.
The letter he wrote crossed on its way a letter the
Captain had just written to his father telling of his
love for the pretty American girl, and of his intended
marriage; and when the Earl received that letter, he
was furiously angry. Bad as his temper was, he had
never given way to it in his life as he gave way to
<a id="page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
it when he read the Captain&rsquo;s letter. For an hour he
raged like a tiger, and then he sat down and wrote
to his son, and ordered him never to come near his
old home, nor to write to his father or brothers again.
</p>

<p>
The Captain was very sad when he read the
letter; he was very fond of England, and he dearly
loved the beautiful home where he had been born; he
had even loved his ill-tempered old father; but he
knew he need expect no kindness from him in the
future. At first he scarcely knew what to do; he had
not been brought up to work, and had no business
experience, but he had courage and plenty of determination.
So <a id="anote-3-13" href="#note-3-13">he sold his commission</a> in the English
army, and after some trouble found a situation in New
York, and married. The change from his old life in
England was very great, but he was young and happy
and he hoped that hard work would do great things
for him in the future. He had a small house in a
quiet street, and his little boy was born there. Though
he was born in so quiet and <a id="anote-3-20" href="#note-3-20">cheap</a> a little home, it
seemed as if there never had been a more fortunate
baby. In the first place, he was always well, and
so he never gave any one trouble; in the second place
he had so sweet a temper and ways so charming that
he was a pleasure to every one; and in the third
place he was so beautiful to look at that he was quite
a picture.
</p>

<p>
When he was old enough to walk out with his
nurse, he was so handsome and strong and rosy that
he attracted every one&rsquo;s attention, and his nurse would
come home and tell his mamma stories of the ladies
who had stopped their carriages to look at and speak
to him, and of how pleased they were when he talked
to them in his cheerful little way, as if he had known
them always. His greatest charm was <a id="anote-3-35" href="#note-3-35">this cheerful, fearless, quaint little way</a>
of making friends with
people.
</p>

<p>
As he grew older, he had a great many <a id="anote-3-38" href="#note-3-38">quaint little ways</a>
which amused and interested people greatly.
He was so much of a companion for his mother that
she scarcely cared for any other. They used to walk
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
together and talk together and play together. When
he was quite a little fellow he learned to read; and
after that he used to lie on the <a id="anote-4-3" href="#note-4-3">hearth-rug,</a> in the
evening, and read aloud&mdash;sometimes stories, and sometimes
big books such as older people read, and sometimes
even the newspaper; and often at such times
Mary, in the kitchen, would hear Mrs. Errol laughing
with delight at the quaint things he said.
</p>

<p>
Mary was very fond of him, and very proud of
him, too. She had been with his mother ever since
he was born; and, after his father&rsquo;s death, had been
cook and housemaid and nurse and everything else.
</p>

<p>
<a id="anote-4-13" href="#note-4-13">&ldquo;Ristycratic,</a> is it?&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like
a young lord he looks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cedric did not know that he looked like a young
lord; he did not know what a lord was. His greatest
friend was the groceryman at the corner. His
name was Mr. Hobbs, and Cedric admired and respected
him very much. He thought him a very rich
and powerful person, he had so many things in his
<a id="anote-4-21" href="#note-4-21">store</a>&mdash;prunes and figs and oranges and biscuits,&mdash;and
he had a horse and waggon. Cedric was fond of the
milkman and the baker and the apple-woman, but he
liked Mr. Hobbs best of all, and was on terms of such
intimacy with him that he went to see him every day,
and often sat with him quite a long time discussing
<a id="anote-4-27" href="#note-4-27">the topics of the hour.</a> It was quite surprising how
many things they found to talk about&mdash;<a id="anote-4-28" href="#note-4-28">the Fourth of July,</a>
for instance. When they began to talk about
the Fourth of July there really seemed no end to it.
Mr. Hobbs had a very bad opinion of &ldquo;the British,&rdquo;
and he told the whole story of the Revolution, relating
very wonderful and patriotic stories about the
villainy of the enemy and the bravery of the Revolutionary
heroes, and he even generously repeated part
of the Declaration of Independence. Cedric was so
excited that his eyes shone and he could hardly wait
to eat his dinner after he went home, he was so
anxious to tell his mamma. It was, perhaps, Mr.
Hobbs who gave him his first interest in politics.
Mr. Hobbs was fond of reading the newspapers, and
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
so Cedric heard a great deal about what was going
on in <a id="anote-5-2" href="#note-5-2">Washington;</a> and Mr. Hobbs would tell him
whether the President was doing his duty or not.
</p>

<p>
When Cedric was between seven and eight years
old, the very strange thing happened which made so
wonderful a change in his life. It was quite curious,
too, that the day it happened he had been talking to
Mr. Hobbs about England and the Queen, and Mr.
Hobbs had said some very severe things about the
aristocracy, being specially indignant against earls and
marquises.
</p>

<p>
They were in the midst of their conversation,
when Mary appeared. Cedric thought she had come
to buy some sugar, perhaps, but she had not. She
looked almost pale and as if she were excited about
something.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come home, <a id="anote-5-17" href="#note-5-17">darlint,&rdquo;</a> she said; &ldquo;the mistress is
<a id="anote-5-18" href="#note-5-18">wantin&rsquo;</a> <a id="anote-5-18-2" href="#note-5-18-2">yez.&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
Cedric slipped down from his stool.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does she want me to go out with her, Mary?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Hobbs. I&rsquo;ll see you again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he reached his own house there was a <a id="anote-5-22" href="#note-5-22">coupé</a>
standing before the door, and some one was in the
little parlour talking to his mamma. Mary hurried
him up stairs and put on his best summer suit of
cream-coloured flannel with the red scarf around the
waist, and combed out his curly locks.
</p>

<p>
When he was dressed, he ran down stairs and
went into the parlour. A tall, thin old gentleman
with a sharp face was sitting in an arm-chair. His
mother was standing near by with a pale face, and
he saw that there were tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Ceddie!&rdquo; she cried out, and ran to her little
boy and caught him in her arms and kissed him in a
little frightened, troubled way. &ldquo;Oh, Ceddie, darling!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tall old gentleman rose from his chair and
looked at Cedric with his sharp eyes. He rubbed his
thin chin with his bony hand as he looked.
</p>

<p>
He seemed not at all displeased.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he said at last, slowly,&mdash;&ldquo;and so this
is little Lord Fauntleroy.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-2-2">
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
CHAPTER II.<br />
CEDRIC&rsquo;S FRIENDS.
</h3>

<p>
There was never a more amazed little boy than
Cedric during the week that followed; there was never
so strange or so <a id="anote-6-3" href="#note-6-3">unreal</a> a week. In the first place,
the story his mamma told him was a very curious one.
He was obliged to hear it two or three times before
he could understand it. He could not imagine what
Mr. Hobbs would think of it. It began with earls;
his grandpapa, whom he had never seen, was an earl;
and his eldest uncle, if he had not been killed by a
fall from his horse, would have been an earl, too, in
time; and after his death, his other uncle would have
been an earl, if he had not died suddenly, in Rome,
of a fever. After that, his own papa, if he had lived,
would have been an earl; but since they all had died
and only Cedric was left, it appeared that <em>he</em> was to
be an earl after his grandpapa&rsquo;s death&mdash;and for the
present he was Lord Fauntleroy.
</p>

<p>
He turned quite pale when he was first told of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! Dearest!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should rather not be
an earl. None of the boys are earls. Can&rsquo;t I <em>not</em>
be one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But it seemed to be unavoidable. And when, that
evening, they sat together by the open window looking
out into the shabby street, he and his mother had a
long talk about it. Cedric sat on his footstool, clasping
one knee in his favourite attitude and wearing a
bewildered little face rather red from the exertion of
thinking. His grandfather had sent for him to come
to England, and his mamma thought he must go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, looking out of the window
with sorrowful eyes, &ldquo;I know your papa would wish
it to be so, Ceddie. I should be a selfish little mother
if I did not send you. When you are a man you will
see why.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ceddie shook his head mournfully. &ldquo;I shall be
very sorry to leave Mr. Hobbs,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Havisham&mdash;who was the family lawyer
of the Earl of Dorincourt, and who had been sent by
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
him to bring Lord Fauntleroy to England&mdash;came the
next day, Cedric heard many things. But, somehow,
it did not console him to hear that he was to be a
very rich man when he grew up, and that he would
have castles here and castles there, and great parks
and deep mines and grand estates and tenantry. He
was troubled about his friend, Mr. Hobbs, and he went
to see him at the store soon after breakfast, in great
anxiety of mind.
</p>

<p>
He found him reading the morning paper, and he
approached him with a grave demeanour. He really
felt it would be a great shock to Mr. Hobbs to hear
what had befallen him, and on his way to the store
he had been thinking how it would be best to <a id="anote-7-14" href="#note-7-14">break the news.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a id="anote-7-16" href="#note-7-16">&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</a> said Mr. Hobbs. <a id="anote-7-16-2" href="#note-7-16-2">&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said Cedric.
</p>

<p>
He did not climb up on the high stool as usual,
but sat down on a biscuit-box and clasped his knee,
and was so silent for a few moments that Mr. Hobbs
finally looked up inquiringly over the top of his newspaper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said again.
</p>

<p>
Cedric gathered all his strength of mind together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hobbs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you remember what
we were talking about yesterday morning?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hobbs,&mdash;&ldquo;seems to me it was
England.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;but just when Mary came
for me, you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs rubbed the back of his head.
</p>

<p>
<a id="anote-7-32" href="#note-7-32">&ldquo;We <em>was</em></a> mentioning Queen Victoria and the
aristocracy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cedric, rather hesitatingly, &ldquo;and&mdash;and
earls; don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; returned Mr. Hobbs; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You said,&rdquo; proceeded Cedric, &ldquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t
have them sitting &rsquo;round on your biscuit barrels.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I did!&rdquo; returned Mr. Hobbs, stoutly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hobbs,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;one is sitting on this
box now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
Mr. Hobbs almost jumped out of his chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cedric announced, with due modesty; &ldquo;<em>I</em>
am one&mdash;or I am going to be. I shan&rsquo;t deceive you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs looked agitated. He rose up suddenly
and went to look at the thermometer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The <a id="anote-8-7" href="#note-8-7">mercury&rsquo;s</a> got into your head!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
turning back to examine his young friend&rsquo;s countenance.
&ldquo;It <em>is</em> a hot day! How do you feel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put his big hand on the little boy&rsquo;s hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ceddie; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. There
is nothing the matter with my head. I&rsquo;m sorry to say
it&rsquo;s true, Mr. Hobbs. That was what Mary came to
take me home for. Mr. Havisham was telling my
mamma, and he is a lawyer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs sank into his chair and mopped his
forehead with his handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>One</em> of us has got a sunstroke!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Cedric, &ldquo;we have not. Mr. Havisham
came all the way from England to tell us
about it. My grandpapa sent him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs stared wildly at the innocent, serious
little face before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is your grandfather?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
Cedric put his hand in his pocket and carefully
drew out a piece of paper, on which something was
written in his own round, irregular hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t easily remember it, so I wrote it
down on this,&rdquo; he said. And he read aloud slowly:
&ldquo;&rsquo;John Arthur Molyneux Errol, Earl of Dorincourt.&rsquo;
That is his name, and he lives in a castle&mdash;in two or
three castles, I think. And my papa, who died, was
his youngest son; and I shouldn&rsquo;t have been a lord or an
earl if my papa hadn&rsquo;t died; and my papa wouldn&rsquo;t
have been an earl if his two brothers hadn&rsquo;t died, and
my grandpapa has sent for me to come to England.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs seemed to grow hotter and hotter. He
mopped his forehead and breathed hard. He began to
see that something very remarkable had happened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what did you say your name was?&rdquo; Mr.
Hobbs inquired.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cedric Errol, Lord Fauntleroy,&rdquo; answered
Cedric. &ldquo;That was what Mr. Havisham called me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hobbs, <a id="anote-9-3" href="#note-9-3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;jiggered!&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
This was an exclamation he always used when
he was very much astonished or excited. He could
think of nothing else to say just at that puzzling
moment.
</p>

<p>
Cedric looked at Mr. Hobbs wistfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;England is a long way off, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s across the Atlantic Ocean,&rdquo; Mr. Hobbs answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rdquo; said Cedric. &ldquo;Perhaps
I shall not see you again for a long time. I don&rsquo;t
like to think of that, Mr. Hobbs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The best of friends must part,&rdquo; said Mr. Hobbs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;we have been friends for a
great many years, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ever since <a id="anote-9-18" href="#note-9-18">you was</a> born,&rdquo; Mr. Hobbs answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; remarked Cedric, with a sigh, &ldquo;I never
thought I should have to be an earl then!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think,&rdquo; said Mr. Hobbs, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no getting
out of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; answered Cedric. &ldquo;My mamma
says that my papa would wish me to do it. But if I
have to be an earl, I can try to be a good one. I&rsquo;m
not going to be a tyrant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His conversation with Mr. Hobbs was a long and
serious one. Once having got over the first shock,
Mr. Hobbs endeavoured to resign himself to the situation,
and before the interview was at an end he
had asked a great many questions. As Cedric could
answer but few of them, he endeavoured to answer
them himself, and explained many things in a way
which would probably have astonished Mr. Havisham,
could that gentleman have heard it.
</p>

<p>
But then there were many things which astonished
Mr. Havisham. He had known all about the old Earl&rsquo;s
disappointment in his elder sons and all about his
fierce rage at Captain Cedric&rsquo;s American marriage,
and he knew how he still hated the gentle little
widow and would not speak of her except with bitter
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
and cruel words. He insisted that she was only a
common American girl, who had entrapped his son
into marrying her because she knew he was an earl&rsquo;s
son. The old lawyer himself had more than half believed
this was all true. When he had been driven
into the cheap street, and his coupé had stopped before
the cheap small house, he had felt actually shocked.
</p>

<p>
When Mary handed him into the small parlour
he looked around it critically. It was plainly furnished
but it had a <a id="anote-10-10" href="#note-10-10">home-like</a> look; the few adornments on
the walls were in good taste, and about the room
were many pretty things which a woman&rsquo;s hand might
have made.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer&rsquo;s experience taught him to read people&rsquo;s
characters very shrewdly, and as soon as he saw Cedric&rsquo;s
mother he knew that the old Earl had made a
great mistake in thinking her a vulgar, mercenary
woman.
</p>

<p>
When he first told Mrs. Errol what he had come
for, she turned very pale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;will he have to be taken away
from me? We love each other so much! He is such
a happiness to me! He is all I have.&rdquo; And her sweet
young voice trembled, and the tears rushed into her
eyes. &ldquo;You do not know what he has been to me!&rdquo;
she said.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer <a id="anote-10-27" href="#note-10-27">cleared his throat.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am obliged to tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the
Earl of Dorincourt is not&mdash;is not very friendly toward
you. He is an old man, and his prejudices are
very strong. He has always especially disliked America
and Americans, and was very much enraged by his
son&rsquo;s marriage. I am sorry to be the bearer of so
unpleasant a communication, but he is very fixed in
his determination not to see you. His plan is that
Lord Fauntleroy shall be educated under his own
supervision; that he shall live with him. The Earl
is attached to Dorincourt Castle, and spends a great
deal of time there. Lord Fauntleroy will, therefore,
be likely to live chiefly at Dorincourt. The Earl offers
to you as a home, Court Lodge, which is situated
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
pleasantly, and is not very far from the castle. He
also offers you a suitable income. Lord Fauntleroy
will be permitted to visit you; the only stipulation
is, that you shall not visit him. You see you will
not be really separated from your son.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He felt a little uneasy lest she should begin to
cry or make a scene.
</p>

<p>
But she did not. She went to the window and
stood with her face turned away for a few moments.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Captain Errol was very fond of Dorincourt,&rdquo; she
said at last. &ldquo;He loved England, and everything
English. It was always a grief to him that he was
parted from his home. I know he would wish, that
his son should know the beautiful old places, and be
brought up in such a way as would be suitable to his
future position.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then she came back to the table and stood looking
up at Mr. Havisham very gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My husband would wish it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It will
be best for my little boy. I know&mdash;I am sure the
Earl would not be so unkind as to try to teach him
not to love me; and I know&mdash;even if he tried&mdash;that
my little boy is too much like his father to be harmed.
I hope, that his grandfather will love Ceddie.
The little boy has a very affectionate nature; and he
has always been loved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham cleared his throat again. He could
not quite imagine the gouty, <a id="anote-11-28" href="#note-11-28">fiery-tempered</a> old Earl
loving any one very much; but he knew that if Ceddie
were at all a credit to his name, his grandfather
would be proud of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord Fauntleroy will be comfortable, I am sure,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;It was with a view to his happiness
that the Earl desired that you should be near enough
to him to see him frequently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When the door opened and the child came into
the room, he recognised in an instant that here was one
of the finest and handsomest little fellows he had ever
seen. His beauty was something unusual. He had a
strong, lithe, graceful little body and a manly little
face; he was so like his father that it was really
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
startling; he had his father&rsquo;s golden hair and his
mother&rsquo;s brown eyes. They were innocently fearless
eyes; he looked as if he had never feared or doubted
anything in his life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is the best-bred-looking and handsomest little
fellow I ever saw,&rdquo; was what Mr. Havisham thought.
What he said aloud was simply, &ldquo;And so this is little
Lord Fauntleroy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cedric did not know he was being observed, and
he only behaved himself in his ordinary manner. He
shook hands with Mr. Havisham in his friendly way
when they were introduced to each other, and he answered
all his questions with the unhesitating readiness
with which he answered Mr. Hobbs.
</p>

<p>
The next time Mr. Havisham met him, he had
quite a long conversation with him&mdash;a conversation
which made him smile, and rub his chin with his
bony hand several times.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Errol had been called out of the parlour, and
the lawyer and Cedric were left together.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham sat in an arm-chair on one side of
the open window; on the other side was another still
larger chair, and Cedric sat in that and looked at
Mr. Havisham. There was a short silence after Mrs.
Errol went out, and Cedric seemed to be studying
Mr. Havisham, and Mr. Havisham was certainly studying
Cedric. He could not make up his mind as to
what an elderly gentleman should say to a little boy.
</p>

<p>
But Cedric relieved him by suddenly beginning
the conversation himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what an
earl is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ceddie. &ldquo;And I think when a boy
is going to be one, he ought to know. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Havisham, &ldquo;An earl
is&mdash;is a very important person.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So is a president!&rdquo; put in Ceddie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An earl,&rdquo; Mr. Havisham went on, &ldquo;is frequently
of very ancient lineage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Ceddie.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
&ldquo;Of very old family&mdash;extremely old.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Cedric, thrusting his hands deeper
into his pockets. &ldquo;I suppose that is the way with the
apple-woman near the park. I dare say she is of
ancient lin-lenage. She is so old it would surprise
you how she can stand up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham felt rather at a loss as he looked
at his companion&rsquo;s innocent, serious little face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid you did not quite understand me,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;When I said &rsquo;ancient lineage&rsquo; I did
not mean old age; I meant that the name of such a
family has been known in the world a long time; perhaps
for hundreds of years persons bearing that name
have been known and spoken of in the history of their
country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like <a id="anote-13-16" href="#note-13-16">George Washington,&rdquo;</a> said Ceddie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard of him ever since I was born, and he was known
about long before that. Mr. Hobbs says he will never
be forgotten. That&rsquo;s because of the Declaration of
Independence, you know, and the Fourth of July. You
see, he was a very brave man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The first Earl of Dorincourt,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham
solemnly, &ldquo;was created an earl four hundred years ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Ceddie. &ldquo;That was a long
time ago! Did you tell Dearest that? It would <a id="anote-13-25" href="#note-13-25">int&rsquo;rust</a> her
very much. She always likes to hear <a id="anote-13-26" href="#note-13-26">cur&rsquo;us</a> things.
What else does an earl do besides being created?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A great many of them have helped to govern
England. Some of them have been brave men and
have fought in great battles in the old days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like to do that myself,&rdquo; said Cedric.
&ldquo;My papa was a soldier, and he was a very brave
man&mdash;as brave as George Washington. Perhaps that
was because he would have been an earl if he hadn&rsquo;t
died. I am glad earls are brave. That&rsquo;s a great
<a id="anote-13-36" href="#note-13-36">&rsquo;vantage</a>&mdash;to be a brave man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is another advantage in being an earl,
sometimes,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham slowly. &ldquo;Some earls
have a great deal of money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was curious because he wondered if his young
friend knew what the power of money was.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good thing to have,&rdquo; said Ceddie innocently.
&ldquo;I wish I had a great deal of money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham. &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; explained Cedric, &ldquo;there are so many
things a person can do with money. You see there&rsquo;s
the apple-woman. If I were very rich I should buy
her a little tent to put her stall in, and a little stove,
and then I should give her a dollar every morning
it rained, so that she could afford to stay at home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham. &ldquo;And what else
would you do if you were rich?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;d do a great many things. Of course I
should buy Dearest all sorts of beautiful things, needle-books
and fans and gold thimbles and rings, and an
encyclopedia, and a carriage, so that she needn&rsquo;t have
to wait for the <a id="anote-14-16" href="#note-14-16">street-cars.</a> And then Dick&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is Dick?&rdquo; asked Mr. Havisham.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dick is a boot-black,&rdquo; said his young lordship,
quite warming up in his interest in plans so exciting.
&ldquo;He is one of the nicest boot-blacks you ever knew.
He stands at the corner of a street down town. I&rsquo;ve
known him for years. Once when I was very little,
I was walking out with Dearest and she bought me
a beautiful ball that bounced, and I was carrying it,
and it bounced into the middle of the street where
the carriages and horses were, and I was so disappointed,
I began to cry&mdash;I was very little. Dick ran
in between the horses and caught the ball for me and
wiped it off with his coat and gave it to me and said;
&rsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, young <a id="anote-14-30" href="#note-14-30">un.&rsquo;</a> So Dearest admired him
very much, and so did I, and ever since then, when
we go down town, we talk to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what would you like to do for him?&rdquo; inquired
the lawyer, rubbing his chin and smiling a
queer smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lord Fauntleroy, settling himself in
his chair with a business air; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d buy Jake out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who is Jake?&rdquo; Mr. Havisham asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Dick&rsquo;s partner, and he is the worst partner
a fellow could have! Dick says so. He isn&rsquo;t a credit
to the business, and he isn&rsquo;t <a id="anote-14-41" href="#note-14-41">square.</a> He cheats, and
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
that makes Dick mad. So if I were rich, I&rsquo;d buy
Jake out and I&rsquo;d get Dick some new clothes and new
brushes, and <a id="anote-15-3" href="#note-15-3">start him out fair.&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What would you get for yourself, if you were
rich?&rdquo; asked Mr. Havisham.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lots of things!&rdquo; answered Lord Fauntleroy briskly:
&ldquo;but first I&rsquo;d give Mary some money for Bridget&mdash;that&rsquo;s
her sister, with twelve children, and a husband
out of work. And I think Mr. Hobbs would
like a gold watch and chain to remember me by, and
a <a id="anote-15-11" href="#note-15-11">meerschaum</a> pipe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The door opened and Mrs. Errol came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sorry to have been obliged to leave you
so long,&rdquo; she said to Mr. Havisham; &ldquo;but a poor woman,
who is in great trouble, came to see me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This young gentleman,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham, &ldquo;has
been telling me about some of his friends, and what
he would do for them if he were rich.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bridget is one of his friends,&rdquo; said Mrs. Errol;
&ldquo;and it is Bridget to whom I have been talking in
the kitchen. She is in great trouble now because her
husband has rheumatic fever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cedric slipped down out of his big chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go and see her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and ask
her how he is. He&rsquo;s a nice man when he is well, he
once made me a sword out of wood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He ran out of the room, and Mr. Havisham rose
from his chair. He seemed to have something in his
mind which he wished to speak of. He hesitated a
moment, and then said, looking down at Mrs. Errol:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Before I left Dorincourt Castle I had an interview
with the Earl, in which he gave me some instructions.
He said that I must let his lordship know that
the change in his life would bring him money and
the pleasures children enjoy; if he expressed any wishes
I was to gratify them, and to tell him that his
grandfather had given him what he wished. I am
aware that the Earl did not expect anything quite like
this; but if it would give Lord Fauntleroy pleasure
to assist this poor woman, I should feel that the Earl
would be displeased if he were not gratified.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mrs. Errol said, &ldquo;that was very kind of
the Earl; Cedric will be so glad! He has always
been fond of Bridget and <a id="anote-16-3" href="#note-16-3">Michael.</a> They are quite
deserving.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham put his thin hand in his breast
pocket and drew forth a large pocket-book. There
was a queer look in his keen face. The truth was,
he was wondering what the Earl of Dorincourt would
say when he was told what was the first wish of his
grandson that had been granted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know <a id="anote-16-11" href="#note-16-11">that you have realised,&rdquo;</a> he said,
&ldquo;that the Earl of Dorincourt is an exceedingly rich
man. I think it would please him to know that Lord
Fauntleroy had been indulged in any fancy. If you
will call him back and allow me, I shall give him
five pounds for these people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would be twenty-five dollars!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Errol. &ldquo;It will seem like wealth to them. I can
scarcely believe that it is true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham, with his
dry smile. &ldquo;A great change has taken place in your
son&rsquo;s life, a great deal of power will lie in his hands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried his mother. &ldquo;And he is such a little
boy&mdash;a very little boy. How can I teach him to use
it well? It makes me half afraid. My pretty little
Ceddie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lawyer slightly cleared his throat. It touched
his worldly, hard old heart to see the tender, timid
look in her brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think, madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if I may judge
from my interview with Lord Fauntleroy this morning,
the next Earl of Dorincourt will think for others
as well as for his noble self. He is only a child yet,
but I think he may be trusted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then his mother went for Cedric and brought him
back into the parlour.
</p>

<p>
His little face looked quite anxious when he came
in. He was very sorry for Bridget.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dearest said you wanted me,&rdquo; he said to Mr.
Havisham. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking to Bridget.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham looked down at him a moment.
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
He felt a little awkward and undecided. As Cedric&rsquo;s
mother had said, he was a very little boy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Earl of Dorincourt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and then
he glanced involuntarily at Mrs. Errol.
</p>

<p>
Little Lord Fauntleroy&rsquo;s mother suddenly kneeled
down by him and put both her tender arms around
his childish body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ceddie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the Earl is your grandpapa,
your own papa&rsquo;s father. He is very, very kind, and
he loves you and wishes you to love him, because the
sons who were his little boys are dead. He wishes
you to be happy and to make other people happy. He
is very rich, and he wishes you to have everything
you would like to have. He told Mr. Havisham so,
and gave him a great deal of money for you. You
can give some to Bridget now, enough to pay her rent
and buy Michael everything. Isn&rsquo;t that fine, Ceddie?
Isn&rsquo;t he good?&rdquo; And she kissed the child on his round
cheek, where the bright colour suddenly flashed up in
his excited amazement.
</p>

<p>
He looked from his mother to Mr. Havisham.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can I have it now?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Can I give it
to her this minute? She&rsquo;s just going.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham handed him the money. It was in
fresh clean <a id="anote-17-25" href="#note-17-25">greenbacks</a> and made a neat roll.
</p>

<p>
Ceddie flew out of the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bridget!&rdquo; they heard him shout, as <a id="anote-17-27" href="#note-17-27">he tore</a> into
the kitchen. &ldquo;Bridget, wait a minute! Here&rsquo;s some
money. It&rsquo;s for you, and you can pay the rent. My
grandpapa gave it to me. It&rsquo;s for you and Michael!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Master Ceddie!&rdquo; cried Bridget, in an awestricken
voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <a id="anote-17-32" href="#note-17-32">twinty-foive</a> dollars is here. <a id="anote-17-32-2" href="#note-17-32-2">Where&rsquo;s</a>
the mistress?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I shall have to go and explain it to her,&rdquo;
Mrs. Errol said.
</p>

<p>
So she, too, went out of the room, and Mr. Havisham
was left alone for a while. He went to the
window and stood looking out into the street reflectively.
He was thinking of the old Earl of Dorincourt,
sitting in his great, splendid, gloomy library at the
castle, gouty and lonely, surrounded by grandeur and
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
luxury, but not really loved by any one, because in all
his long life he had never really loved any one but
himself. He could fill his castle with guests if he
chose, but he knew that in secret the people who
would accept his invitations were afraid of his frowning
old face and sarcastic, biting speeches.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham knew his hard, fierce ways by heart,
and he was thinking of him as he looked out of the
window into the quiet, narrow street. And there rose
in his mind, in sharp contrast, the picture of the
cheery, handsome little fellow sitting in the big chair
and telling his story of his friends, Dick and the apple-woman,
in his generous, innocent, honest way. And
he thought of the immense income, the beautiful, majestic
estates, the wealth, and power for good or evil,
which in the course of time would lie in the small,
<a id="anote-18-17" href="#note-18-17">chubby</a> hands little Lord Fauntleroy thrust so deep
into his pockets.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will make a great difference,&rdquo; he said to
himself. &ldquo;It will make a great difference.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cedric and his mother came back soon after.
Cedric was in high spirits. He was glowing with
enjoyment of Bridget&rsquo;s relief and rapture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She cried!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She said she was crying for
joy. I never saw any one cry for joy before. My
grandpapa must be a very good man. I didn&rsquo;t know
he was so good a man. It&rsquo;s more&mdash;more agreeable to
be an earl than I thought it was. I&rsquo;m almost glad&mdash;I&rsquo;m
almost <em>quite</em> glad I&rsquo;m going to be one.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-2-3">
CHAPTER III.<br />
LEAVING HOME.
</h3>

<p>
Cedric&rsquo;s good opinion of the advantages of being
an earl increased greatly during the next week. It
seemed almost impossible for him to <a id="anote-18-32" href="#note-18-32">realise</a> that there
was scarcely anything he might wish to do which he
could not do easily; in fact I think it may be said
that he did not fully realise it at all. But at least
he understood, after a few conversations with Mr.
Havisham, that he could gratify all <a id="anote-18-37" href="#note-18-37">his nearest wishes,</a>
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
and <a id="anote-19-1" href="#note-19-1">he proceeded to gratify them</a> with a simplicity
and delight which caused Mr. Havisham much diversion.
In the week before they sailed for England, he did
many curious things. The lawyer long after remembered
the morning they went down together to pay a visit
to Dick, and the afternoon they so amazed the apple-woman
of ancient lineage by stopping before her stall
and telling her she was to have a tent, and a stove,
and a shawl, and a sum of money which seemed to
her quite wonderful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For I have to go to England and be a lord,&rdquo;
explained Cedric, sweet-temperedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very good apple-woman,&rdquo; he said to
Mr. Havisham as they walked away, leaving the proprietress
of the stall almost gasping for breath, and
not at all believing in her great fortune. &ldquo;Once, when
I fell down and <a id="anote-19-17" href="#note-19-17">cut</a> my knee, she gave me an apple
for nothing. I&rsquo;ve always remembered her for it. You
know you always remember people who are kind to
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It had never occurred to his honest, simple, little
mind that there were people who could forget kindnesses.
</p>

<p>
The interview with Dick was quite exciting. Dick
had just been having a great deal of trouble with
Jake, and was in low spirits when they saw him.
His amazement when Cedric calmly announced that
they had come to give him what seemed a very great
thing to him, and would set all his troubles right,
almost <a id="anote-19-30" href="#note-19-30">struck him dumb.</a> Lord Fauntleroy&rsquo;s manner of announcing
the object of his visit was very simple and unceremonious
and the end of the matter was that Dick
bought Jake out, and found himself the possessor of the
business, and some new brushes and a most astonishing
sign and outfit. He could not believe in his good
luck any more easily than the apple-woman of ancient
lineage could believe in hers. He scarcely seemed to
realise anything until Cedric put out his hand to shake
hands with him before going away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; he said; and though he tried
to speak steadily, there was a little tremble in his
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
voice and he winked his big brown eyes. &ldquo;And I
hope trade&rsquo;ll be good. I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m going away to
leave you, but I wish you&rsquo;d write to me, because we
were always good friends. And here&rsquo;s where you must
send your letter.&rdquo; And he gave him a slip of paper.
&ldquo;And my name isn&rsquo;t Cedric Errol any more; it&rsquo;s Lord
Fauntleroy and&mdash;and good-bye, Dick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dick winked his eyes also, and yet they looked
rather moist about the lashes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish <a id="anote-20-10" href="#note-20-10">ye wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;</a> away,&rdquo; he said in a
husky voice. Then he winked his eyes again. Then
he looked at Mr. Havisham and touched his cap.
<a id="anote-20-13" href="#note-20-13">&ldquo;Thanky,</a> sir, for bringin&rsquo; him down here an&rsquo; <a id="anote-20-13-2" href="#note-20-13-2">fur wot</a>
ye&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Until the day of his departure, his lordship spent
as much time as possible with Mr. Hobbs in the store.
Gloom had settled upon Mr. Hobbs; he was much depressed
in spirits. When his young friend brought to
him in triumph the parting gift of a gold watch and
chain, Mr. Hobbs found it difficult to acknowledge it
properly. He laid the case on his stout knee, and
blew his nose violently several times.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something written on it,&rdquo; said Cedric,&mdash;&ldquo;inside
the case. I told the man myself what to
say. &rsquo;From his oldest friend, Lord Fauntleroy, to
Mr. Hobbs. When this you see, remember me.&rsquo; I
don&rsquo;t want you to forget me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs blew his nose very loudly again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t forget you,&rdquo; he said, speaking a trifle
huskily, as Dick had spoken; &ldquo;nor don&rsquo;t you go and
forget me when you get among the British aristocracy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t forget you, whoever I was among,&rdquo;
answered his lordship. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent my happiest hours
with you; at least, some of my happiest hours. I hope
you&rsquo;ll come to see me some time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At last all the preparations were complete; the
day came when the trunks were taken to the steamer,
and the hour arrived when the carriage stood at the
door. Then a curious feeling of loneliness came upon
the little boy. His mamma had been shut up in her
room for some time; when she came down the stairs,
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
her eyes looked large and wet, and her sweet mouth
was trembling. Cedric went to her, and she bent down
to him, and he put his arms around her and they
kissed each other. He knew something made them
both sorry, though he scarcely knew what it was; but
one tender little thought rose to his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We liked this little house, Dearest, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We always will like it, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she answered in a low, sweet voice.
&ldquo;Yes, darling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then they went into the carriage and Cedric
sat very close to her, and as she looked back out of
the window, he looked at her and stroked her hand
and held it close.
</p>

<p>
And then, it seemed almost directly, they were
on the steamer in the midst of the wildest bustle and
confusion; carriages were driving down and leaving
passengers; passengers were getting into a state of
excitement about baggage which had not arrived and
threatened to be too late; big trunks and cases were
being bumped down and dragged about; sailors were
uncoiling ropes and hurrying to and fro; officers were
giving orders; ladies and gentlemen and children and
nurses were coming on board&mdash;some were laughing
and looked gay, some were silent and sad, here and
there two or three were crying and touching their
eyes with their handkerchiefs. Cedric found something
to interest him on every side; he looked at the piles
of rope, at the furled sails, at the tall, tall masts
which seemed almost to touch the hot blue sky; he
began to make plans for conversing with the sailors
and gaining some information on the subject of pirates.
</p>

<p>
It was just at the very last, when he was leaning
on the railing of the upper deck and watching
the final preparations, that his attention was called to
a slight bustle in one of the groups not far from him.
Some one was hurriedly forcing his way through this
group and coming toward him. It was a boy, with
something red in his hand. It was Dick. He came
up to Cedric quite breathless.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve run all the way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come down
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
to see ye off. Trade&rsquo;s been prime! I bought this for
ye out o&rsquo; what <a id="anote-22-2" href="#note-22-2">I made</a> yesterday. Ye <a id="anote-22-2-2" href="#note-22-2-2">kin</a> wear it
when ye get among the swells. It&rsquo;s a <a id="anote-22-3" href="#note-22-3">hankercher.&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
He poured it all forth as if in one sentence. A
bell rang and he made a leap away before Cedric had
time to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; <a id="anote-22-7" href="#note-22-7">he panted.</a> &ldquo;Wear it when ye get
among the swells.&rdquo; And he darted off and was gone.
</p>

<p>
Cedric held the handkerchief in his hand. It was
of bright red silk, ornamented with purple horse-shoes
and horses&rsquo; heads, he leaned forward and waved it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye, Dick!&rdquo; he shouted, lustily. &ldquo;Thank
you! Good-bye, Dick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the big steamer moved away, and the people
cheered again, and Cedric&rsquo;s mother drew the veil over
her eyes, and on the shore there was left great confusion;
but Dick saw nothing save that bright, childish
face and the bright hair that the sun shone on and
the breeze lifted, and he heard nothing but the hearty
childish voice calling &ldquo;Good-bye, Dick!&rdquo; as little Lord
Fauntleroy steamed slowly away from the home of
his birth to the unknown land of his ancestors.
</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-2-4">
CHAPTER IV.<br />
IN ENGLAND.
</h3>

<p>
It was during the voyage that Cedric&rsquo;s mother
told him that his home was not to be hers; and when
he first understood it, his grief was so great that Mr.
Havisham saw that the Earl had been wise in making
the arrangements that his mother should be quite near
him, and see him often; for it was very plain he could
not have borne the separation otherwise. But his mother
managed the little fellow so sweetly and lovingly, and
made him feel that she would be so near him, that,
after a while, he ceased to be oppressed by the fear
of any real parting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My house is not far from the Castle, Ceddie,&rdquo;
she repeated each time the subject was referred to&mdash;&ldquo;a
very little way from yours, and you can always
run in and see me every day, and you will have so
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
many things to tell me! and we shall be so happy
together! It is a beautiful place. Your papa has often
told me about it. He loved it very much; and you
will love it too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should love it better if you were there,&rdquo; his
small lordship said, with a heavy little sigh.
</p>

<p>
He could not but feel puzzled by so strange a
state of affairs, which could put his &ldquo;Dearest&rdquo; in one
house and himself in another.
</p>

<p>
The fact was that Mrs. Errol had thought it better
not to tell him why this plan had been made.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should prefer he should not be told,&rdquo; she said
to Mr. Havisham. &ldquo;He would not really understand;
he would only be shocked and hurt; and I feel sure
that his feeling for the Earl will be a more natural
and affectionate one if he does not know that his
grandfather dislikes me so bitterly. It would make
a barrier between them, even though Ceddie is such
a child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So Cedric only knew that there was some mysterious
reason for the arrangement, some reason which
he was not old enough to understand, but which would
be explained when he was older. He was puzzled;
but after many talks with his mother, in which she placed
before him the bright side of the picture, the dark
side of it gradually began to fade out, though now
and then Mr. Havisham saw him sitting in some queer
little old-fashioned attitude, watching the sea, with a
very grave face, and more than once he heard an unchildish
sigh rise to his lips.
</p>

<p>
The people who had been sea-sick had no sooner
recovered from their sea-sickness, and come on deck
to recline in their steamer-chairs and enjoy themselves,
than every one seemed to know the romantic story of
Little Lord Fauntleroy, and every one took an interest
in the little fellow, who ran about the ship or
walked with his mother or the tall, thin old lawyer,
or talked to the sailors. Every one liked him, he made
friends everywhere. He was ever ready to make
friends. When the gentlemen walked up and down
the deck, and let him walk with them, he stepped out
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
with a manly, sturdy little tramp, and answered all
their jokes with much gay enjoyment; when the ladies
talked to him, there was always laughter in the group
of which he was the centre; when he played with the
children, there was always magnificent fun on hand.
Among the sailors he had the heartiest friends; he
heard miraculous stories about pirates and shipwrecks
and desert islands; he learned to splice ropes and rig
toy ships, and gained an amount of information concerning
<a id="anote-24-10" href="#note-24-10">&ldquo;tops&rsquo;les&rdquo;</a> and <a id="anote-24-10-2" href="#note-24-10-2">&ldquo;mains&rsquo;les,&rdquo;</a> quite surprising.
His conversation had, indeed, quite <a id="anote-24-11" href="#note-24-11">a nautical flavour</a>
at times.
</p>

<p>
It was eleven days after he had said good-bye
to his friend Dick before he reached Liverpool; and
it was on the night of the twelfth day that the carriage,
in which he and his mother and Mr. Havisham
had driven from the station, stopped before the gates
of Court Lodge.
</p>

<p>
Mary had come with them to attend her mistress,
and she had reached the house before them. When
Cedric jumped out of the carriage Mary stood in the
doorway.
</p>

<p>
Lord Fauntleroy sprang at her with a gay little
shout.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you get here, Mary?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mary,
Dearest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad you are here, Mary,&rdquo; Mrs. Errol said
to her in a low voice. &ldquo;It is such a comfort to me
to see you. It takes the strangeness away.&rdquo; And
she held out her little hand, which Mary squeezed
encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
The English servants looked with curiosity at
both the boy and his mother. They had heard all
sorts of rumours about them both; they knew why
Mrs. Errol was to live at the lodge and her little boy
at the Castle; but they did not know what sort of a
little lord had come among them; they did not quite
understand the character of the next Earl of Dorincourt.
</p>

<p>
He pulled off his overcoat quite as if he were
used to doing things for himself, and began to look
about him. He looked about the broad hall, at the
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
pictures and <a id="anote-25-1" href="#note-25-1">stags&rsquo; antlers</a> and curious things that
ornamented it. They seemed curious to him because
he had never seen such things before in a private
house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is a very pretty house,
isn&rsquo;t it? I am glad you are going to live here. It&rsquo;s
quite a large house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was quite a large house compared to the one
in the <a id="anote-25-9" href="#note-25-9">shabby</a> New York street, and it was very pretty
and cheerful.
</p>

<p>
Mary led them into a big bright room; its ceiling
was low, and the furniture was heavy and beautifully
carved. There was a great tiger-skin before the fire,
and an arm-chair on each side of it. A stately white
cat had responded to Lord Fauntleroy&rsquo;s stroking and
followed him down stairs, and when he threw himself
down upon the rug, she curled herself up grandly beside
him as if she intended to make friends. Cedric
was so pleased that he put his head down by hers,
and lay stroking her, not noticing what his mother
and Mr. Havisham were saying.
</p>

<p>
They were, indeed, speaking in a rather low tone.
Mrs. Errol looked a little pale and agitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He need not go to-night?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He will
stay with me to-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Havisham in the same low
tone; &ldquo;it will not be necessary for him to go to-night.
I myself will go to the Castle as soon as we have
dined, and inform the Earl of our arrival.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Errol smiled faintly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His lordship does not know all that he is taking
from me,&rdquo; she said rather sadly. Then she looked
at the lawyer. &ldquo;Will you tell him, if you please,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;that I should rather not have the income
he proposed to settle upon me. I am obliged to accept
the house, and I thank him for it, because it makes
it possible for me to be near my child; but I have a
little money of my own and I should rather not take
the other. As he dislikes me so much, I should feel
a little as if I were selling Cedric to him. I am
giving him up only because I love him enough to
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
forget myself for his good, and because his father
would wish it to be so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham rubbed his chin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is very strange,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He will be
very angry. He won&rsquo;t understand it, but I will deliver
your message.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then the dinner was brought in and they
sat down together, the big cat taking a seat on a
chair near Cedric&rsquo;s and purring majestically throughout
the meal.
</p>

<p>
When, later in the evening, Mr. Havisham presented
himself at the Castle, he was taken at once
to the Earl. He found him sitting by the fire in a
luxurious easy-chair, his foot on a gout-stool. He
looked at the lawyer sharply from under his <a id="anote-26-15" href="#note-26-15">shaggy</a>
eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;well, Havisham, come back,
have you? What&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord Fauntleroy and his mother are at Court
Lodge,&rdquo; replied Mr. Havisham. &ldquo;They bore the voyage
very well and are in excellent health.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl made a half-impatient sound and moved
his hand restlessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Glad to hear it,&rdquo; he said brusquely. &ldquo;So far,
so good. Make yourself comfortable. Have a glass
of wine and settle down. What else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His lordship remains with his mother to-night.
To-morrow I will bring him to the Castle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl&rsquo;s elbow was resting on the arm of his
chair; he put his hand up and shielded his eyes with it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;go on. What kind of a lad is
he? I don&rsquo;t care about the mother; what sort of a
lad is he? Healthy and well grown?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Apparently very healthy, and quite well grown,&rdquo;
replied the lawyer.
</p>

<p>
<a id="anote-26-36" href="#note-26-36">&ldquo;Straight-limbed</a> and well enough to look at?&rdquo;
demanded the Earl.
</p>

<p>
A very slight smile touched Mr. Havisham&rsquo;s
thin lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rather a handsome boy, I think, my lord, as boys
go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though I am scarcely a judge, perhaps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
There was a silence of a few moments. It was
Mr. Havisham who broke it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a message to deliver from Mrs. Errol,&rdquo;
he remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any of her messages!&rdquo; growled his
lordship; &ldquo;the less I hear of her the better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a rather important one,&rdquo; explained the
lawyer. &ldquo;She prefers not to accept the income you
proposed <a id="anote-27-9" href="#note-27-9">to settle on her.&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
The Earl started visibly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham repeated his words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She says it is not necessary, and that as the
relations between you are not friendly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not friendly!&rdquo; <a id="anote-27-15" href="#note-27-15">ejaculated</a> my lord savagely; &ldquo;I
should say they were not friendly! I hate to think
of her! A mercenary American! I don&rsquo;t wish to
see her!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham, &ldquo;you can scarcely
call her mercenary. She has asked for nothing. She
does not accept the money you offer her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All done for effect!&rdquo; <a id="anote-27-22" href="#note-27-22">snapped</a> his noble lordship.
&ldquo;She thinks I shall admire her spirit. I don&rsquo;t
admire it! It&rsquo;s only American independence! I won&rsquo;t
have her living like a beggar at my park gates. She
shall have the money, whether she likes it or not!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t spend it,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether she spends it or not!&rdquo;
<a id="anote-27-29" href="#note-27-29">blustered my lord.</a> &ldquo;She shall have it sent to her.
She wants to give the boy a bad opinion of me! I
suppose she has poisoned his mind against me already!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham. &ldquo;I have another message,
which will prove to you that she has not done
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear it!&rdquo; panted the Earl, out
of breath with anger and excitement and gout.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Havisham delivered it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She asks you not to let Lord Fauntleroy hear
anything which would lead him to understand that
you separate him from her because of your prejudice
against her. He is very fond of her, and she is convinced
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
that it would cause a barrier to exist between
you. She has told him that he is too young to understand
the reason, but shall hear it when he is older.
She wishes that there should be no shadow on your
first meeting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl sank back into his chair. His <a id="anote-28-6" href="#note-28-6">deep-set</a>
fierce old eyes gleamed under his <a id="anote-28-7" href="#note-28-7">beetling</a> brows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, now!&rdquo; he said, still breathlessly. &ldquo;Come,
now! You don&rsquo;t mean the mother hasn&rsquo;t told him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not one word, my lord,&rdquo; replied the lawyer
coolly. &ldquo;That I can assure you. The child is prepared
to believe you the most amiable and affectionate
of grandparents. And as I carried out your commands
in every detail, while in New York, he certainly regards
you as a wonder of generosity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He does, eh?&rdquo; said the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I give you my word of honour,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham,
&ldquo;that Lord Fauntleroy&rsquo;s impressions of you will
depend entirely upon yourself. And if you will pardon
the liberty I take in making the suggestion, I
think you will succeed better with him if you take
the precaution not to speak slightingly of his mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh, pooh!&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;The youngster&rsquo;s
only seven years old!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has spent those seven years at his mother&rsquo;s
side,&rdquo; returned Mr. Havisham; &ldquo;and she has all his
affection.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-2-5">
CHAPTER V.<br />
AT THE CASTLE.
</h3>

<p>
It was late in the afternoon when the carriage
containing little Lord Fauntleroy and Mr. Havisham
drove up the long avenue which led to the castle.
The Earl had given orders that his grandson should
arrive in time to dine with him, and for some reason
best known to himself, he had also ordered that the
child should be sent alone into the room in which he
intended to receive him. As the carriage rolled up
the avenue, Lord Fauntleroy sat leaning comfortably
against the luxurious cushions, and regarded the prospect
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
with great interest. He was, in fact, interested
in everything he saw. He had been interested in the
carriage, with its large, splendid horses and their
glittering harness; he had been interested in the tall
coachman and footman, with their resplendent livery;
and he had been especially interested in the coronet
on the panels, and <a id="anote-29-7" href="#note-29-7">had struck up an acquaintance</a>
with the footman for the purpose of inquiring what
it meant.
</p>

<p>
The carriage rolled on and on between the great,
beautiful trees which grew on each side of the avenue
and stretched their broad swaying branches in an arch
across it. Cedric had never seen such trees, they were
so grand and stately, and their branches grew so low
down on their huge trunks. He did not then know
that Dorincourt Castle was one of the most beautiful
in all England; that its park was one of the broadest
and finest, and its trees and avenue almost without
rivals. But he did know that it was all very beautiful.
Now and then they passed places where tall
ferns grew in masses, and again and again the ground
was azure with the bluebells swaying in the soft
breeze. Several times he started up with a laugh of
delight as a rabbit leaped up from under the <a id="anote-29-24" href="#note-29-24">greenery</a>
and scudded away with a twinkle of short white
tail behind it. Once a covey of partridges rose with
a sudden whir and flew away, and then he shouted
and clapped his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said to Mr.
Havisham. &ldquo;I never saw such a beautiful place. It&rsquo;s
prettier even than <a id="anote-29-31" href="#note-29-31">Central Park.&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
He was rather puzzled by the length of time they
were on their way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;from the
gate to the front door?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is between three and four miles,&rdquo; answered
the lawyer.
</p>

<p>
It was not long after this that they saw the castle.
It rose up before them stately and beautiful and grey,
the last rays of the sun casting dazzling lights on its
many windows. It had turrets and battlements and
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
towers; a great deal of ivy grew upon its walls; all
the broad open space about it was laid out in terraces
and lawns and beds of brilliant flowers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most beautiful place I ever saw!&rdquo; said
Cedric, his round face flushing with pleasure. &ldquo;It
reminds any one of a king&rsquo;s palace. I saw a picture
of one once in a <a id="anote-30-7" href="#note-30-7">fairy-book.&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
He saw the great entrance-door thrown open and
many servants standing in two lines looking at him.
He wondered why they were standing there, and admired
their liveries very much. He did not know that
they were there to do honour to the little boy to
whom all this splendour would one day belong. At
the head of the line of servants there stood an elderly
woman in a <a id="anote-30-15" href="#note-30-15">rich</a> <a id="anote-30-15-2" href="#note-30-15-2">plain</a> black silk gown; she had grey
hair and wore a cap. As he entered the hall she stood
nearer than the rest, and the child thought from the
look in her eyes that she was going to speak to him.
Mr. Havisham, who held his hand, paused a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Lord Fauntleroy, this is Mrs. Mellon, who is the housekeeper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cedric gave her his hand, his eyes lighting up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was it you who sent the cat?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
much obliged to you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mellon&rsquo;s handsome old face looked very much
pleased.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The cat left two beautiful kittens here,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;they shall be sent up to your lordship&rsquo;s nursery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham said a few words to her in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the library, sir,&rdquo; Mrs. Mellon replied. &ldquo;His
lordship is to be taken there alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, the very tall footman in
livery, who had escorted Cedric to the library door,
opened it and announced: &ldquo;Lord Fauntleroy, my Lord,&rdquo;
in quite a majestic tone.
</p>

<p>
Cedric crossed the threshold into the room. It
was a very large and splendid room, with massive
carven furniture in it, and shelves upon shelves of
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
books; the furniture was so dark, and the draperies
so heavy, the <a id="anote-31-2" href="#note-31-2">diamond-paned windows</a> were so deep,
and it seemed such a distance from one end of it to
the other, that, since the sun had gone down, the
effect of it all was rather gloomy. For a moment
Cedric thought there was nobody in the room, but soon
he saw that by the fire burning on the wide hearth
there was a large easy-chair, and that in that chair
some one was sitting&mdash;some one who did not at first
turn to look at him.
</p>

<p>
But he had attracted attention in one quarter at
least. On the floor, by the arm-chair, lay a dog, a
huge tawny mastiff, with body and limbs almost as
big as a lion&rsquo;s; and this great creature rose majestically
and slowly, and marched toward the little fellow
with a heavy step.
</p>

<p>
Then the person in the chair spoke. &ldquo;Dougal,&rdquo;
he called, &ldquo;come back, <a id="anote-31-18" href="#note-31-18">sir.&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
But there was no fear in little Lord Fauntleroy&rsquo;s
heart. He put his hand on the big dog&rsquo;s collar and
they strayed forward together, Dougal sniffing as he went.
</p>

<p>
And then the Earl looked up. What Cedric saw
was a large old man with shaggy white hair and
eyebrows, and a nose like an eagle&rsquo;s beak between
his deep fierce eyes. What the Earl saw was a graceful
childish figure in a black velvet suit, with a lace
collar, and with <a id="anote-31-27" href="#note-31-27">love-locks</a> waving about the handsome,
manly little face, whose eyes met his with a look of
innocent good-fellowship. There was a sudden glow
of triumph and exultation in the fiery old Earl&rsquo;s heart
as he saw what a strong beautiful boy this grandson
was, and how unhesitatingly he looked up as he stood
with his hand on the big dog&rsquo;s neck.
</p>

<p>
Cedric came quite close to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you the Earl?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your grandson,
you know, that Mr. Havisham brought. I&rsquo;m Lord
Fauntleroy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand because he thought it must
be the polite and proper thing to do even with earls.
&ldquo;I hope you are very well,&rdquo; he continued, with the
utmost friendliness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
The Earl shook hands with him, with a curious
gleam in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Glad to see me, are you?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Lord Fauntleroy, &ldquo;very.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a chair near him, and he sat down on
it; it was a high-backed, rather tall chair, and his
feet did not touch the floor when he had settled himself
in it, but he seemed to be quite comfortable as
he sat there and regarded his august relative intently
and modestly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Any boy would love his grandfather,&rdquo; continued
he, &ldquo;especially one that had been as kind to him as
you have been.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another queer gleam came into the old nobleman&rsquo;s
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been kind to you, have I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Lord Fauntleroy brightly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
<a id="anote-32-18" href="#note-32-18">ever so much</a> obliged to you about Bridget, and the
apple-woman, and Dick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bridget!&rdquo; exclaimed the Earl. &ldquo;Dick! The apple-woman!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; explained Cedric; &ldquo;the ones you gave me
all that money for&mdash;the money you told Mr. Havisham
to give me if I wanted it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; ejaculated his lordship. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, is it?
The money you were to spend as you liked. What
did you buy with it? I should like to hear something
about that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He drew his shaggy eyebrows together and looked
at the child sharply. He was secretly curious to
know in what way the lad had indulged himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lord Fauntleroy, &ldquo;perhaps you didn&rsquo;t
know about Dick, and the apple-woman and Bridget.
I forgot you lived such a long way off from them.
They were particular friends of mine. And you see
Michael had the fever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Michael?&rdquo; asked the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Michael is Bridget&rsquo;s husband, and they were in
great trouble. And Bridget used to come to our house
and cry. And the evening Mr. Havisham was there,
she was in the kitchen crying because they had almost
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
nothing to eat and couldn&rsquo;t pay the rent; and I went
in to see her, and Mr. Havisham sent for me and he
said you had given him some money for me. And I
ran as fast as I could into the kitchen and gave it
to Bridget; and that made it all right; and Bridget
could scarcely believe her eyes. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so
obliged to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Earl in his deep voice, &ldquo;that
was one of the things you did for yourself, was it?
What else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there was Dick,&rdquo; Cedric answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
like Dick, he&rsquo;s so <a id="anote-33-12" href="#note-33-12">square.&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
This was an Americanism the Earl was not prepared
for.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; he inquired.
</p>

<p>
Lord Fauntleroy paused a moment to reflect. He
was not very sure himself what it meant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it means that he wouldn&rsquo;t cheat any
one,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;or hit a boy who was under his
size, and that he blacks people&rsquo;s boots very well and
makes them shine as much as he can. He&rsquo;s a <a id="anote-33-21" href="#note-33-21">professional</a>
boot-black.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s one of your acquaintances, is he?&rdquo; said
the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an old friend of mine,&rdquo; replied his grandson.
&ldquo;Not quite as old as Mr. Hobbs, but quite old.
He gave me a present just before the ship sailed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put his hand into his pocket and drew forth
a neatly folded red object and opened it with an air
of affectionate pride. It was the red silk handkerchief
with the large purple horse-shoes and heads on it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He gave me this,&rdquo; said his young lordship. &ldquo;I
shall keep it always. You can wear it round your
neck or keep it in your pocket. It&rsquo;s a keepsake. I
put some poetry in Mr. Hobbs&rsquo; watch. It was, &rsquo;When
this you see, remember me.&rsquo; When this I see, I shall
always remember Dick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sensation of the Right Honourable the Earl
of Dorincourt could scarcely be described.
</p>

<p>
He could not help seeing that the little boy took
him for a friend and treated him as one, without
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
having any doubt of him at all. It was quite <a id="anote-34-1" href="#note-34-1">plain</a>
as the little fellow sat there in his tall chair and
talked in his friendly way that it had never occurred
to him that this large, fierce-looking old man could be
anything but kind to him, and rather pleased to see
him there. And it was plain, too, that, in his childish
way, he wished to please and interest his grandfather.
Cross, and hard-hearted, and <a id="anote-34-8" href="#note-34-8">worldly</a> as the old Earl
was, he could not help feeling a secret and novel
pleasure in this very confidence.
</p>

<p>
So the old man leaned back in his chair, and led
his young companion on to telling him still more of
himself, and with that odd gleam in his eyes watched
the little fellow as he talked. Lord Fauntleroy was
quite willing to answer all his questions and chatted
on in his <a id="anote-34-16" href="#note-34-16">genial</a> little way quite composedly. He told
him all about Dick, and the apple-woman, and Mr. Hobbs.
In the course of the conversation, he reached the Fourth
of July and the Revolution, and was just becoming
enthusiastic, when dinner was announced.
</p>

<p>
Cedric left his chair and went to his noble kinsman.
He looked down at his gouty foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like me to help you?&rdquo; he said politely.
&ldquo;You could lean on me, you know. Once when
Mr. Hobbs hurt his foot with a potato-barrel rolling
on it, he used to lean on me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl looked his valiant young relative over
from head to foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think you could do it?&rdquo; he asked gruffly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <em>think</em> I could,&rdquo; said Cedric. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m strong. I&rsquo;m
seven, you know. You could lean on your stick on
one side, and on me on the other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;you may try.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cedric gave him his stick, and began to assist
him to rise. Usually the footman did this, and <a id="anote-34-35" href="#note-34-35">was violently sworn at</a>
<a id="anote-34-36" href="#note-34-36">when his lordship had an extra twinge of gout.</a>
</p>

<p>
But this evening he did not swear, though his
gouty foot gave him more twinges than one. He chose
to try an experiment. He got up slowly and put his
hand on the small shoulder presented to him with so
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
much courage. Little Lord Fauntleroy made a careful
step forward, looking down at the gouty foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just lean on me,&rdquo; he said, with encouraging good
cheer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk very slowly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If the Earl had been supported by the footman
he would have rested less on his stick and more on
his assistant&rsquo;s arm. And yet it was part of his experiment
to let his grandson feel his burden as no
light weight. It was quite a heavy weight indeed,
and after a few steps his young lordship&rsquo;s face grew
quite hot, and his heart beat rather fast, but he braced
himself sturdily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of leaning on me,&rdquo; <a id="anote-35-13" href="#note-35-13">he panted.</a>
<a id="anote-35-14" href="#note-35-14">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right</a>&mdash;if&mdash;if it isn&rsquo;t a very long way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not really very far to the dining-room,
but it seemed rather a long way to Cedric, before
they reached the chair at the head of the table.
</p>

<p>
When the hand was removed from his shoulder,
and the Earl was fairly seated, Cedric took out Dick&rsquo;s
handkerchief and wiped his forehead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a warm night, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have been doing some rather hard work,&rdquo;
said the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Lord Fauntleroy, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t exactly
hard, but I got a little warm. A person will
get warm in summer time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And he rubbed his damp curls rather vigorously
with the gorgeous handkerchief. His own chair was
placed at the other end of the table, opposite his
grandfather&rsquo;s. It was a chair with arms, and intended
for a much larger individual than himself; indeed,
everything he had seen so far&mdash;the great rooms, with
their high ceilings, the massive furniture, the big footman,
the big dog, the Earl himself&mdash;were all of proportions
calculated to make this little lad feel that he
was very small indeed. But that did not trouble him.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding his solitary existence the Earl
chose to live in considerable state. He was fond of
his dinner, and he dined in a formal style. Cedric
looked at him across a glitter of splendid glass and
plate, which to his unaccustomed eyes seemed quite
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
dazzling. A stranger looking on might well have
smiled at the picture&mdash;the great stately room, the big
liveried servants, the bright lights, the glittering silver
and glass, the fierce-looking old nobleman at the head
of the table and the very small boy at the foot.
Dinner was usually a very serious matter with the
Earl&mdash;and it was a very serious matter with the cook,
if his lordship was not pleased or had an indifferent
appetite. To-day, however, his appetite seemed a trifle
better than usual, perhaps because his grandson gave
him something to think of. <a id="anote-36-11" href="#note-36-11">He kept looking at him</a>
across the table. He did not say very much himself, but
he managed to make the boy talk. He had never imagined
that he could be entertained by hearing a child talk,
but Lord Fauntleroy at once puzzled and amused him.
</p>

<p>
Cedric finished his dinner first, and then he leaned
back in his chair and took a survey of the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must be very proud of your house,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such a beautiful house. I never saw anything
so beautiful; but, of course, as I&rsquo;m only seven,
I haven&rsquo;t seen much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you think I must be proud of it, do you?&rdquo;
said the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should think any one would be proud of it,&rdquo;
replied Lord Fauntleroy. &ldquo;I should be proud of it, if
it were my house. Everything about it is beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he paused an instant and looked across the
table rather <a id="anote-36-28" href="#note-36-28">wistfully.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very big house for just two people to live
in, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is quite large enough for two,&rdquo; answered the
Earl. &ldquo;Do you find it too large?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His little lordship hesitated a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was only thinking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if two
people lived in it who were not very good companions,
they might feel lonely sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think I shall make a good companion?&rdquo;
inquired the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cedric, &ldquo;I think you will. Mr.
Hobbs and I were great friends. He was the best
friend I had except Dearest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
The Earl made a quick movement of his bushy
eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is Dearest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is my mother,&rdquo; said Lord Fauntleroy, in a
rather low, quiet little voice.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he was a trifle tired, as his bed-time was
nearing, and perhaps the feeling of weariness brought
to him a vague sense of loneliness in the remembrance
that to-night he was not to sleep at home, watched
over by the loving eyes of that &ldquo;best friend&rdquo; of his.
They had always been &ldquo;best friends,&rdquo; this boy and
his young mother. He could not help thinking of her,
and the more he thought of her the less was he inclined
to talk, and by the time the dinner was at an
end the Earl saw that there was a faint shadow on
his face. But Cedric bore himself with excellent
courage, and when they went back to the library,
though the tall footman walked on one side of his
master, the Earl&rsquo;s hand rested on his grandson&rsquo;s
shoulder, though not so heavily as before.
</p>

<p>
When the footman left them alone, Cedric sat
down upon the hearth-rug near Dougal. For a few
minutes he stroked the dog&rsquo;s ears in silence and looked
at the fire.
</p>

<p>
The Earl watched him. The boy&rsquo;s eyes looked
wistful and thoughtful, and once or twice he gave a
little sigh. The Earl sat still, and kept his eyes fixed
on his grandson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fauntleroy,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;what are you
thinking of?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy looked up with a manful effort at
a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was thinking about Dearest,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and&mdash;and
I think I&rsquo;d better get up and walk up and
down the room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He rose up, and put his hands in his small pockets,
and began to walk to and fro. His eyes were very
bright, and his lips were pressed together, but he kept
his head up and walked firmly. Dougal moved lazily
and looked at him and then stood up. He walked
over to the child, and began to follow him uneasily.
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
Fauntleroy drew one hand from his pocket and laid
it on the dog&rsquo;s head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very nice dog,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my friend.
He knows how I feel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; asked the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never was away from my own house before,&rdquo;
said the boy, with a troubled look in his brown eyes.
&ldquo;It makes a person feel a strange feeling when he
has to stay all night in another person&rsquo;s castle instead
of in his own house. But Dearest is not very
far away from me. She told me to remember that&mdash;and&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m seven&mdash;and I can look at the picture
she gave me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put his hand in his pocket, and brought out
a small violet velvet-covered case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You see, you press this
spring and it opens, and she is in there!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had come close to the Earl&rsquo;s chair, and, as
he drew forth the little case, he leaned against the
old man&rsquo;s arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; he said, as the case opened; and
he looked up with a smile.
</p>

<p>
The Earl knitted his brows; he did not wish to
see the picture, but he looked at it in spite of himself;
and there looked up at him from it such a pretty
young face&mdash;a face so like the child&rsquo;s at his side&mdash;that
it quite startled him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you think you are very fond of her?&rdquo;
he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Lord Fauntleroy, in a gentle
tone, and with simple directness; &ldquo;I do think so, and
I think it&rsquo;s true. You see Mr. Hobbs was my friend, and
Dick and Bridget and Michael they were my friends
too; but Dearest&mdash;well she is my <a id="anote-38-34" href="#note-38-34"><em>close</em></a> friend, and we
always tell each other everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His young lordship slipped down upon the hearth-rug,
and sat there with the picture still in his hand.
</p>

<p>
The Earl did not speak again. He leaned back
in his chair and watched him. A great many strange
new thoughts passed through the old nobleman&rsquo;s mind.
Dougal had stretched himself out and gone to sleep
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
with his head on his huge paws. There was a long
silence.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
In about half an hour&rsquo;s time Mr. Havisham was
ushered in. The great room was very still when he
entered. The Earl was still leaning back in his chair.
He moved as Mr. Havisham approached, and held up
his hand in a gesture of warning&mdash;it seemed as if he
had scarcely intended to make the gesture&mdash;as if it
were almost involuntary. Dougal was still asleep, and
close beside the great dog, sleeping also, with his
curly head upon his arm, lay little Lord Fauntleroy.
</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-2-6">
CHAPTER VI.<br />
THE EARL AND HIS GRANDSON.
</h3>

<p>
When Lord Fauntleroy wakened in the morning&mdash;he
had not wakened at all when he had been carried
to bed the night before,&mdash;the first sound he was
conscious of were the crackling of a wood fire and
the murmur of voices.
</p>

<p>
He moved on his pillow, and turned over, opening
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
There were two women in the room. Everything
was bright and cheerful with gay-flowered chintz.
There was a fire on the hearth, and the sunshine was
streaming in through the <a id="anote-39-22" href="#note-39-22">ivy-entwined</a> windows. Both
women came toward him, and he saw that one of
them was Mrs. Mellon, the housekeeper, and the
other a comfortable, middle-aged woman, with a face
as kind and good-humoured as a face could be.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-morning, my lord,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mellon. &ldquo;Did
you sleep well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His lordship rubbed his eyes and smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were carried up-stairs when you were asleep,&rdquo;
said the housekeeper. &ldquo;This is your bedroom,
and this is Dawson, who is to take care of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy sat up in bed and held out his hand
to Dawson, as he had held it out to the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much
obliged to you for coming to take care of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
&ldquo;You can call her Dawson, my lord,&rdquo; said the
housekeeper with a smile. &ldquo;She is used to being
called Dawson.&mdash;She will do anything you ask her to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I will, bless him,&rdquo; said Dawson, in her
comforting, good-humoured voice. &ldquo;He shall dress
himself, and I&rsquo;ll stand by, ready to help him if he
wants me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; responded Lord Fauntleroy; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a little hard sometimes about the buttons, you know,
and then I have to ask somebody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he went into the adjoining room to take his
breakfast and saw what a great room it was, and
found there was another adjoining it, which Dawson
told him was his also, the feeling that he was very
small indeed came over him again so strongly that
he confided it to Dawson, as he sat down to the
table on which the pretty breakfast service was
arranged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am a very little boy,&rdquo; he said rather wistfully,
&ldquo;to live in such a large castle, and have so many big
rooms&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; said Dawson, &ldquo;you feel just a little
strange at first, that&rsquo;s all; but you&rsquo;ll get over that
very soon, and then you&rsquo;ll like it here. It&rsquo;s such a
beautiful place, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very beautiful place, of course,&rdquo; said
Fauntleroy, with a little sigh; &ldquo;but I should like it
better if I didn&rsquo;t miss Dearest so. I always had my
breakfast with her in the morning, and put the sugar
and cream in her tea for her, and handed her the
toast. That made it very sociable, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; answered Dawson, comfortably, &ldquo;you
know you can see her every day, and <a id="anote-40-33" href="#note-40-33">there&rsquo;s no knowing</a>
how much you&rsquo;ll have to tell her. Bless
you! wait till you&rsquo;ve walked about a bit and seen
things&mdash;the dogs and the stables with all the horses
in them. And, dear me, you haven&rsquo;t looked even into
the very next room yet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is there?&rdquo; asked Fauntleroy,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait until you&rsquo;ve had your breakfast, and then
you shall see,&rdquo; said Dawson.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
At this he naturally began to grow curious, and
he applied himself assiduously to his breakfast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he said, slipping off his seat a few
minutes later; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough. Can I go and look
at it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dawson nodded and led the way.
</p>

<p>
When she opened the door of the room, he stood
upon the threshold and looked about him in amazement.
He did not speak; he only put his hands in
his pockets and stood there looking in.
</p>

<p>
The room was a large one too, as all the rooms
seemed to be, and it appeared to him more beautiful
than the rest, only in a different way. The furniture
was not so massive and antique as was that in the
rooms he had seen down stairs; the draperies and
<a id="anote-41-16" href="#note-41-16">rugs</a> and walls were brighter; there were shelves full
of books, and on the tables were numbers of toys&mdash;beautiful,
ingenious things&mdash;such as he had looked
at with wonder and delight through the shop windows
in New York.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It looks like a boy&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; he said at last,
<a id="anote-41-22" href="#note-41-22">catching his breath a little.</a> &ldquo;Who do they belong to?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go and look at them,&rdquo; said Dawson. &ldquo;They
belong to you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To me!&rdquo; he cried &ldquo;to me! Why do they belong
to me? Who gave them to me?&rdquo; And he sprang
forward with a gay little shout. It seemed almost
too much to be believed. &ldquo;It was Grandpapa!&rdquo; he
said, with his eyes as bright as stars. &ldquo;I know it
was Grandpapa!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it was his lordship,&rdquo; said Dawson.
</p>

<p>
It was a tremendously exciting morning. There
were so many things to be examined, so many experiments
to be tried; each novelty was so absorbing
that he could scarcely turn from it to look at the next.
</p>

<p>
The Earl had passed a bad night and had spent
the morning in his room; but at noon, after he had
lunched, he sent for his grandson.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy answered the summons at once. He
came down the broad staircase with a bounding step;
the Earl heard him run across the hall, and then
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
the door opened and he came in with red cheeks and
sparkling eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was waiting for you to send for me,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I was ready a long time ago. I&rsquo;m <a id="anote-42-4" href="#note-42-4"><em>ever</em> so much</a>
obliged to you for all those things! I&rsquo;m <em>ever</em> so much
obliged to you! I have been playing with them all
the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;you like them, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like them so much&mdash;well, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you
how much!&rdquo; said Fauntleroy, his face glowing with
delight. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s like <a id="anote-42-11" href="#note-42-11">base-ball.</a> I tried
to teach Dawson, but she couldn&rsquo;t quite understand it
just at first. But you know all about it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="anote-42-14" href="#note-42-14">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;</a> replied the Earl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an
American game, isn&rsquo;t it? Is it something like
cricket?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never saw cricket,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy; &ldquo;but Mr.
Hobbs took me several times to see base-ball. It&rsquo;s
a splendid game. You get so excited! Would you
like me to go and get my game and show it to you?
Perhaps it would amuse you and make you forget
about your foot. Does your foot hurt you very much
this morning?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More than I enjoy,&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then perhaps you couldn&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; said the
little fellow, anxiously. &ldquo;Perhaps it would bother
you to be told about the game. Do you think it
would amuse you, or do you think it would bother
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go and get it,&rdquo; said the Earl.
</p>

<p>
It certainly was a novel entertainment this&mdash;making
a companion of a child who offered to teach
him to play games, but the very novelty of it amused
him. <a id="anote-42-34" href="#note-42-34">There was a smile lurking</a> about the Earl&rsquo;s
mouth when Cedric came back with the box containing
the game in his arms, and an expression of the most
eager interest on his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I pull that little table over here to your
chair?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ring for Thomas,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;He will
place it for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
&ldquo;Oh, I can do it myself,&rdquo; answered Fauntleroy.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very heavy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied his grandfather. The lurking
smile deepened on the old man&rsquo;s face as he watched
the little fellow&rsquo;s preparations; there was such an
absorbed interest in them. The small table was dragged
forward and placed by his chair, and the game taken
from its box and arranged upon it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very interesting when you once begin,&rdquo; said
Fauntleroy. &ldquo;You see, the black pegs can be your
side and the white ones mine. They&rsquo;re men, you
know, and once round the field is a home run and
counts one&mdash;and these are the outs&mdash;and here is the
first base and that&rsquo;s the second and that&rsquo;s the third
and that&rsquo;s the home-base.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He entered into the details of explanation with
the greatest animation. He showed all the attitudes
of pitcher and catcher and batter in the real game.
</p>

<p>
When at last the explanations and illustrations
were at an end and the game began in good earnest,
the Earl still found himself entertained. His young
companion was wholly absorbed; he played with all
his childish heart; his gay little laughs when he
made a good throw, his enthusiasm over a &ldquo;home
run,&rdquo; his impartial delight over his own good luck or
his opponent&rsquo;s would have given a <a id="anote-43-26" href="#note-43-26">flavour</a> to any game.
</p>

<p>
If, a week before, any one had told the Earl of
Dorincourt that <a id="anote-43-28" href="#note-43-28">on that particular morning</a> he would
be forgetting his gout and his bad temper in a child&rsquo;s
game, with a <a id="anote-43-30" href="#note-43-30">curly-headed</a> small boy for a companion,
he would without doubt have made himself very unpleasant;
and yet he certainly had forgotten himself
when the door opened and Thomas announced a visitor.
</p>

<p>
The visitor in question, who was an elderly
gentleman in black, and no less a person than the
clergyman of the parish, was so startled by the
amazing scene which met his eye, that <a id="anote-43-37" href="#note-43-37">he almost fell back a pace,</a>
and ran some risk of colliding with
Thomas.
</p>

<p>
There, was, in fact, no part of his duty that the
Reverend Mr. Mordaunt found so decidedly unpleasant
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
as that part which compelled him to call upon his
noble patron at the Castle. His noble patron, indeed,
usually made these visits as disagreeable as it lay in
his lordly power to make them. He abhorred churches
and charities, and flew into violent rages when any
of his <a id="anote-44-6" href="#note-44-6">tenantry</a> took the liberty of being poor and ill
and needing assistance. During all the years in which
Mr. Mordaunt had been in charge of Dorincourt parish,
the rector certainly did not remember having seen his
lordship, of his own free will, do any one a kindness,
or, under any circumstances whatever, show that he
thought of any one but himself.
</p>

<p>
Judge then of his amazement when, as Thomas
opened the library door, his ears were greeted by a
delighted ring of childish laughter.
</p>

<p>
The Earl glanced around, and when he saw who
it was, Mr. Mordaunt was still more surprised to see
that he looked almost as if he had forgotten for the
moment how unpleasant he really could make himself
when he tried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said in his harsh voice, but giving his
hand rather graciously. &ldquo;Good morning, Mordaunt.
I&rsquo;ve found a new employment, you see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put his other hand on Cedric&rsquo;s shoulder&mdash;perhaps
deep down in his heart <a id="anote-44-25" href="#note-44-25">there was a stir of gratified pride</a>
that it was such an heir he had to
present; there was a spark of something like pleasure
in his eyes as he moved the boy slightly forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the new Lord Fauntleroy,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Fauntleroy, this is Mr. Mordaunt, the rector of the
parish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy looked up at the gentleman in the
clerical garments, and gave him his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very glad to make your acquaintance, sir,&rdquo;
he said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mordaunt held the small hand in his a moment
as he looked down at the child&rsquo;s face, smiling
involuntarily, He liked the little fellow from that
instant&mdash;as in fact people always did like him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Lord
Fauntleroy,&rdquo; said the rector. &ldquo;You made a long
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
journey to come to us. A great many people will be
glad to know you made it safely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It <em>was</em> a long way,&rdquo; answered Fauntleroy; &ldquo;but
Dearest, my mother, was with me and I wasn&rsquo;t lonely.
Of course you are never lonely if your mother is with
you; and the ship was beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take a chair, Mordaunt,&rdquo; said the Earl. Mr.
Mordaunt sat down. He glanced from Fauntleroy to
the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your lordship is greatly to be congratulated,&rdquo;
he said warmly. But the Earl <a id="anote-45-11" href="#note-45-11">plainly</a> had no intention
of showing his feelings on the subject.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is like his father,&rdquo; he said rather gruffly.
&ldquo;Let us hope he&rsquo;ll conduct himself more creditably.&rdquo;
And then he added: &ldquo;Well, what is it this morning,
Mordaunt? Who is in trouble now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was not as bad as Mr. Mordaunt had expected,
but he hesitated a second before he began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is Higgins,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Higgins of Edge Farm.
He has been very unfortunate. He was ill himself
last autumn, and his children had scarlet fever. He
is in trouble about his <a id="anote-45-22" href="#note-45-22">rent</a> now. Newick tells him
if he doesn&rsquo;t pay it he must leave the place; and of
course that would be a very serious matter. His wife
is ill, and he came to me yesterday to beg me to see
you about it, and ask you for time. He thinks if you
would give him time he could <a id="anote-45-27" href="#note-45-27">catch up</a> again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They all think that,&rdquo; said the Earl, looking
rather <a id="anote-45-29" href="#note-45-29">black.</a>
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy made a movement forward. He had
been standing between his grandfather and the visitor,
listening with all his might. He had begun to be
interested in Higgins at once. He wondered how
many children there were, and if the scarlet fever
had hurt them very much. His eyes were wide open
and were fixed upon Mr. Mordaunt with intense interest
as that gentleman went on with the conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Higgins is a well-meaning man,&rdquo; said the rector,
making an effort <a id="anote-45-39" href="#note-45-39">to strengthen his plea.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a bad enough tenant,&rdquo; replied his lordship.
&ldquo;And he is always behindhand, Newick tells me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
&ldquo;He is in great trouble now,&rdquo; said the rector,
&ldquo;He is very fond of his wife and children, and if the
farm is taken from him they may literally starve.
He cannot give them the nourishing things they need.
Two of the children were left very <a id="anote-46-5" href="#note-46-5">low</a> after the fever,
and the doctor orders for them wine and luxuries that
Higgins cannot afford.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this Fauntleroy moved a step nearer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was the way with Michael,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
The Earl slightly started. &ldquo;I forgot <em>you</em>!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I forgot we had a philanthropist in the room. Who
was Michael?&rdquo; And the gleam of queer amusement
came back into the old man&rsquo;s <a id="anote-46-13" href="#note-46-13">deep-set</a> eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was Bridget&rsquo;s husband, who had the fever,&rdquo;
answered Fauntleroy; &ldquo;and he couldn&rsquo;t pay the rent
or buy wine and things. And you gave me that money
to help him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl drew his brows together into a curious
frown, which somehow was scarcely grim at all. He
glanced across at Mr. Mordaunt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what sort of a landed proprietor
he will make,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I told Havisham the boy
was to have what he wanted&mdash;and what he wanted,
it seems, was money to give to beggars.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! but they weren&rsquo;t beggars,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy
eagerly. &ldquo;Michael was a splendid bricklayer! They
all worked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;they were not beggars.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He bent his gaze on the boy for a few seconds
in silence. &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he said, at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What would <em>you</em> do in this case?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It must be confessed that Mr. Mordaunt experienced
for the moment a curious sensation. Being a man of
great thoughtfulness, and having spent so many years
on the estate of Dorincourt, <a id="anote-46-35" href="#note-46-35">he realised</a> very strongly
what power for good or evil would be given in the
future to this one small boy standing there, his brown
eyes wide open, his hands deep in his pockets; and
the thought came to him also that a great deal of
power might, perhaps, through the caprice of a proud,
self-indulgent old man be given to him now, and that
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
if his young nature were not a simple and generous
one, it might be the worst thing that could happen,
not only for others, but for himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what would <em>you</em> do in such a case?&rdquo; demanded
the Earl.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy drew a little nearer, and laid one hand
on his knee, with the most confiding air of good comradeship.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I were very rich,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;and not only just
a little boy, I should let him stay, and give him the
things for his children; but then, I am only a boy.&rdquo;
Then, after a second&rsquo;s pause, in which his face brightened
visibly, &ldquo;<em>You</em> can do anything, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said my lord, staring at him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
your opinion, is it?&rdquo; And he was not displeased either.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean you can give any one anything,&rdquo; said
Fauntleroy. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Newick?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is my agent,&rdquo; answered the Earl, &ldquo;and some
of my tenants are not over-fond of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to write him a letter now?&rdquo; inquired
Fauntleroy. &ldquo;Shall I bring you the pen and
ink? I can take the game off this table.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It plainly had not for an instant occurred to him
that Newick would be allowed to do his worst.
</p>

<p>
The Earl paused a moment, still looking at him.
&ldquo;Can you write?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;but not very well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Move the things from the table,&rdquo; commanded
my lord, &ldquo;and bring the pen and ink, and a sheet of
paper from my desk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mordaunt&rsquo;s interest began to increase. Fauntleroy
did as he was told very deftly. In a few moments,
the sheet of paper, the big inkstand, and the
pen were ready.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said gaily, &ldquo;now you can write it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are to write it,&rdquo; said the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed Fauntleroy, and a flush overspread
bis forehead. &ldquo;Will it do if I write it? I don&rsquo;t
always spell quite right when I haven&rsquo;t a dictionary
and nobody tells me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will do,&rdquo; answered the Earl. &ldquo;Higgins will
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
not complain of the spelling. I&rsquo;m not the philanthropist;
you are. Dip your pen in the ink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy took up the pen and dipped it in the
ink-bottle, then he arranged himself in position, leaning
on the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;what must I say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may say, <a id="anote-48-7" href="#note-48-7">&rsquo;Higgins is not to be interfered with,</a>
for the present,&rsquo; and sign it &rsquo;Fauntleroy,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
the Earl.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy dipped his pen in the ink again, and
resting his arm, began to write. It was rather a slow
and serious process, but he gave his whole soul to it.
After a while, however, the manuscript was complete,
and he handed it to his grandfather with a smile
slightly tinged with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think it will do?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
The Earl looked at it, and <a id="anote-48-17" href="#note-48-17">the corners of his mouth twitched a little.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;Higgins will find it entirely
satisfactory.&rdquo; And he handed it to Mr. Mordaunt.
</p>

<p>
What Mr. Mordaunt found written was this:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>
&ldquo;Dear mr. Newik if you pleas mr. higins is not to be inturfeared
with for the present and oblige
</p>

<p class="sign">
&ldquo;Yours <a id="anote-48-25" href="#note-48-25">rispecferly</a><br />
&ldquo;Fauntleroy.&rdquo;
</p>

</div>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hobbs always signed his letters that way,&rdquo;
said Fauntleroy; &ldquo;and I thought I&rsquo;d better say &rsquo;please.&rsquo;
Is that exactly the right way to spell &rsquo;interfered&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly the way it is spelled in the dictionary,&rdquo;
answered the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was afraid of that,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy. &ldquo;I ought
to have asked. You see, <a id="anote-48-33" href="#note-48-33">that&rsquo;s the way with</a> words
of more than one syllable; you have to look in the
dictionary. It&rsquo;s always safest. I&rsquo;ll write it over again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And write it over again he did, making quite an
imposing copy, and taking precautions in the matter
of spelling by consulting the Earl himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Spelling is a curious thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so
often different from what you expect it to be. I
used to think &rsquo;please&rsquo; was spelled p-l-e-e-s, but it
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
<a id="corr-6"></a>isn&rsquo;t, you know; and you&rsquo;d think &rsquo;dear&rsquo; was spelled
d-e-r-e, if you didn&rsquo;t inquire. Sometimes it almost
discourages you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Mordaunt went away, he took the
letter with him, and he took something else with
him also&mdash;namely, a <a id="anote-49-6" href="#note-49-6">pleasanter</a> feeling and a more
hopeful one than he had ever carried home with him
down that avenue on any previous visit he had made
at Dorincourt Castle.
</p>

<p>
When he was gone, Fauntleroy, who had accompanied
him to the door, went back to his grandfather.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I go to Dearest now?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think
she will be waiting for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl was silent a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is something in the stable for you to see
first,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ring the bell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy, with his quick
little flush, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much obliged; but I think I&rsquo;d
better see it to-morrow. She will be expecting me
all the time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the Earl. &ldquo;We will order
the carriage.&rdquo; Then he added dryly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pony.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy drew a long breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A pony!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Whose pony is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yours,&rdquo; replied the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mine?&rdquo; cried the little fellow. &ldquo;Mine&mdash;like the
things up stairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his grandfather. &ldquo;Would you like
to see it? Shall I order it <a id="anote-49-30" href="#note-49-30">to be brought round?&rdquo;</a>
Fauntleroy&rsquo;s cheeks grew redder and redder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never thought I should have a pony!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I never thought that! How glad Dearest will be.
You give me <em>everything</em>, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you wish to see it?&rdquo; inquired the Earl.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy drew a long breath. &ldquo;I <em>want</em> to see
it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to see it so much I can hardly
wait. But I&rsquo;m afraid there isn&rsquo;t time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You <em>must</em> go and see your mother this afternoon?&rdquo;
asked the Earl. &ldquo;You think you can&rsquo;t put
it off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy, &ldquo;she has been thinking
about me all the morning, and I have been thinking
about her!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;You have, have you?
Ring the bell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As they drove down the avenue, under the arching
trees, he was rather silent. But Fauntleroy was
not. He talked about the pony. What colour was
it? How big was it? What was its name? What
did it like to eat best? How old was it? How early
in the morning might he get up and see it?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dearest will be so glad!&rdquo; <a id="anote-50-12" href="#note-50-12">he kept saying.</a> &ldquo;She
will be so much obliged to you for being so kind
to me! She knows I always liked ponies so much,
but we never thought I should have one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He leaned back against the cushions and regarded
the Earl with rapt interest for a few minutes
and in entire silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you must be the best person in the
world,&rdquo; he burst forth at last. &ldquo;You are always
doing good, aren&rsquo;t you?&mdash;and thinking about other
people. Dearest says that is the best kind of goodness;
not to think about yourself, but to think about
other people. That is just the way you are, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His lordship was so <a id="anote-50-25" href="#note-50-25">dumfounded</a> to find himself
presented in such agreeable colours, that he did not
know exactly what to say.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy went on, still regarding him with admiring
eyes&mdash;those great, clear, innocent eyes!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You make so many people happy,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Michael and Bridget and their ten children,
and the apple-woman, and Dick, and Mr. Hobbs, and
Mr. Higgins and Mrs. Higgins and their children,
and Mr. Mordaunt&mdash;because of course he was glad&mdash;and
Dearest and me, about the pony and all the
other things. Do you know, I&rsquo;ve counted it up on
my fingers and in my mind, and it&rsquo;s twenty-seven
people you&rsquo;ve been kind to. That&rsquo;s a good many&mdash;twenty-seven!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I was the person who was kind to them&mdash;was
I?&rdquo; said the Earl.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
&ldquo;Why, yes, you know,&rdquo; answered Fauntleroy.
&ldquo;You made them all happy. Do you know,&rdquo; with
some delicate hesitation, &ldquo;that people are sometimes
mistaken about earls when they don&rsquo;t know them?
Mr. Hobbs was. I am going to write to him, and
tell him about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was Mr. Hobbs&rsquo;s opinion of earls?&rdquo; asked
his lordship.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you see, the difficulty was,&rdquo; replied his
young companion, &ldquo;that he didn&rsquo;t know any, and
he&rsquo;d only read about them in books. He thought&mdash;you
mustn&rsquo;t mind it&mdash;that they were gory tyrants;
and he said he wouldn&rsquo;t have them hanging around
his store. But if he&rsquo;d known <em>you</em>, I&rsquo;m sure he would
have felt quite different. I shall tell him about you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What shall you tell him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall tell him,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy, glowing with
enthusiasm, &ldquo;that you are the kindest man I ever
heard of. And&mdash;and I hope when I grow up, I shall
be just like you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just like me!&rdquo; repeated his lordship, looking
at the little kindling face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Just</em> like you,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy, adding modestly,
&ldquo;if I can. Perhaps I&rsquo;m not good enough but
I&rsquo;m going to try.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The carriage rolled on down the stately avenue
under the beautiful, broad-branched trees, through the
spaces of green shade and lanes of golden sunlight.
Fauntleroy saw again the lovely places where the
ferns grew high and the bluebells swayed in the
breeze; he saw the deer, standing or lying in the
deep grass, turn their large <a id="anote-51-32" href="#note-51-32">startled</a> eyes as the carriage
passed, and caught glimpses of the brown rabbits
as <a id="anote-51-34" href="#note-51-34">they scurried away.</a> He heard <a id="anote-51-34-2" href="#note-51-34-2">the whirr</a> of
the partridges and the calls and songs of the birds,
and it all seemed even more beautiful to him than
before. All his heart was filled with pleasure and
happiness in the beauty that was on every side. But
the old Earl saw and heard very different things,
though he was apparently looking out too. He saw
a long life, in which there had been neither generous
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
deeds nor kind thoughts; he saw years in which
a man who had been young and strong and rich
and powerful had used his youth and strength and
wealth and power only to please himself and kill
time as the days and years succeeded each other;
he saw this man, when the time had been killed
and old age had come, solitary and without real
friends in the midst of all his splendid wealth; he
saw people who disliked or feared him, and people
who would flatter and cringe to him, but no one
who really cared whether he lived or died, unless they
had something to gain or lose by it.
</p>

<p>
And the fact was, indeed, that he had never
before condescended to reflect upon it at all, and he
only did so now because a child had believed him
better than he was.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy thought the Earl&rsquo;s foot must be hurting
him, his brows knitted themselves together so,
as he looked out at the park; and thinking this, the
considerate little fellow tried not to disturb him,
and enjoyed the trees and the ferns and the deer
in silence. But at last, the carriage, having passed
the gates and <a id="anote-52-23" href="#note-52-23">bowled</a> through the green lanes for a
short distance, stopped. They had reached Court
Lodge; and Fauntleroy was out upon the ground
almost before the big footman had time to open the
carriage door.
</p>

<p>
The Earl wakened from his reverie with a start.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are we here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy. &ldquo;Let me give you your
stick. Just lean on me when you get out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not going to get out,&rdquo; replied his lordship
<a id="anote-52-33" href="#note-52-33">brusquely.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not&mdash;not to see Dearest?&rdquo; exclaimed Fauntleroy
with astonished face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Dearest&rsquo; will excuse me,&rdquo; said the Earl dryly.
&ldquo;Go to her and tell her that not even a new pony
would keep you away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She will be disappointed,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy. &ldquo;She
will want to see you very much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;The carriage
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
will call for you as we come back.&mdash;Tell Jeffries
to drive on, Thomas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thomas closed the carriage door: and, after a
puzzled look, Fauntleroy ran up the drive. The Earl
had the opportunity&mdash;of seeing a pair of handsome,
strong little legs <a id="anote-53-6" href="#note-53-6">flash over the ground</a> with astonishing
rapidity. Evidently their owner had no intention
of losing any time. The carriage rolled slowly away,
but his lordship did not at once lean back; he still
looked out. Through a space in the trees he could
see the house door; it was wide open. The little figure
<a id="anote-53-12" href="#note-53-12">dashed up</a> the steps; another figure&mdash;a little figure
too, slender and young, in its black gown&mdash;ran
to meet it. It seemed as if they flew together, as
Fauntleroy leaped into his mother&rsquo;s arms, hanging
about her neck and covering her sweet young face
with kisses.
</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-2-7">
CHAPTER VII.<br />
AT CHURCH.
</h3>

<p>
On the following Sunday morning, Mr. Mordaunt
had a large congregation. Indeed, he could scarcely
remember any Sunday on which the church had been
so crowded. People appeared upon the scene who
seldom did him the honour of coming to hear his
sermons. There were even people from Hazelton, which
was the next parish. There were hearty, sunburned
farmers, stout, comfortable, <a id="anote-53-25" href="#note-53-25">apple-cheeked</a> wives in their
best bonnets and most gorgeous shawls, and half a
dozen children or so to each family. The doctor&rsquo;s wife
was there, with her four daughters. Mrs. Kimsey and
Mr. Kimsey, who kept the druggist&rsquo;s shop, and made
pills, and did up powders for everybody within ten
miles, sat in their pew; Mrs. Dibble in hers, Miss
Smiff, the village dressmaker, and her friend Miss
Perkins, the milliner, sat in theirs; the doctor&rsquo;s young
man was present, and the druggist&rsquo;s apprentice; in fact,
almost every family on the country side was represented,
in one way or another.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
In the course of the preceding week, many wonderful
stories had been told of little Lord Fauntleroy.
</p>

<p>
The Reverend Mr. Mordaunt had told the story
of Higgins at his own dinner table, and the servant
who had heard it had told it in the kitchen, and from
there it had spread like wildfire.
</p>

<p>
And on market-day, when Higgins had appeared
in town, he had been questioned on every side, and
Newick had been questioned too, and in response
had shown to two or three people the note signed
&ldquo;Fauntleroy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so the farmers&rsquo; wives had found plenty to
talk of <a id="anote-54-13" href="#note-54-13">over their tea and their shopping,</a> and they
had done the subject full justice and made the most
of it. And on Sunday they had either walked to
church or had been driven in their gigs by their husbands,
who were perhaps a trifle curious themselves
about the new little lord who was to be in time the
owner of the soil.
</p>

<p>
It was by no means the Earl&rsquo;s habit to attend
church, but he chose to appear on this first Sunday&mdash;it
was his whim to present himself in the huge
family pew, with Fauntleroy at his side.
</p>

<p>
There were many loiterers in the churchyard that
morning. There were groups at the gates and in the
porch, and there had been much discussion as to whether
my lord would really appear or not. When this discussion
was at its height, one good woman suddenly
uttered an exclamation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;that must be the mother, pretty
young thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
All who heard turned and looked at the slender
figure in black coming up the path. The veil was
thrown back from her face and they could see how
fair and sweet it was, and how the bright hair curled
as softly as a child&rsquo;s under the little widow&rsquo;s cap.
</p>

<p>
She was not thinking of the people about; she
was thinking of Cedric, and of his visits to her, and
his joy over his new pony, on which he had actually
ridden to her door the day before, sitting very straight
and looking very proud and happy. But soon she
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
could not help being attracted by the fact that she
was being looked at and that her arrival had created
some sort of sensation. She first noticed it because
an old woman in a red cloak made a bobbing <a id="anote-55-4" href="#note-55-4">curtsy</a>
to her, and then another did the same thing and said,
&ldquo;God bless you, my lady!&rdquo; and one man after another
took off his hat as she passed. For a moment she
did not understand, and then she realised that it was
because she was little Lord Fauntleroy&rsquo;s mother that
they did so, and she flushed rather shyly, and smiled
and bowed too and said, &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; in a gentle
voice to the old woman, who had blessed her. She
had scarcely passed through the stone porch into the
church before the great event of the day happened.
The carriage from the Castle, with its handsome horses
and tall liveried servants, bowled round the corner
and down the green lane.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; went from one looker-on to
another.
</p>

<p>
And then the carriage drew up, and Thomas stepped
down and opened the door, and a little boy, dressed
in black velvet, and with a splendid <a id="anote-55-22" href="#note-55-22">mop</a> of bright
waving hair, jumped out.
</p>

<p>
Every man, woman, and child looked curiously
upon him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the Captain <a id="anote-55-26" href="#note-55-26">over again!&rdquo;</a> said those of the
on-lookers who remembered his father. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the
Captain&rsquo;s self, to the life!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stood there in the sunlight looking up at the
Earl, as Thomas helped that nobleman out, with the
most affectionate interest that could be imagined.
The instant he could help, he put out his hand and
offered his shoulder as if he had been seven feet high.
It was plain enough to every one that however it
might be with other people, the Earl of Dorincourt
struck no terror into the breast of his grandson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just lean on me,&rdquo; they heard him say. &ldquo;How
glad the people are to see you, and how well they
all seem to know you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take off your cap, Fauntleroy,&rdquo; said the Earl.
&ldquo;They are bowing to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
&ldquo;To me!&rdquo; cried Fauntleroy, whipping off his cap
in a moment, baring his bright head to the crowd,
and turning shining, puzzled eyes on them as he tried
to bow to every one at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God bless your lordship!&rdquo; said the curtsying,
red-cloaked old woman who had spoken to his mother;
&ldquo;long life to you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy. And then
they went into the church, and were looked at there,
on their way up the <a id="anote-56-10" href="#note-56-10">aisle</a> to the square <a id="anote-56-10-2" href="#note-56-10-2">red-cushioned and curtained</a>
pew. When Fauntleroy was fairly seated
he made two discoveries which pleased him: the
first was that, <a id="anote-56-13" href="#note-56-13">across the church</a> where he could look
at her, his mother sat and smiled at him; the second,
that at one end of the pew against the wall knelt
two quaint figures carven in stone, facing each other
as they kneeled on either side of a pillar supporting
two stone missals, their hands folded as if in prayer,
their dress very antique and strange. On the tablet
by them was written something of which he could
only read the curious words:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here <a id="anote-56-22" href="#note-56-22">lyethe ye bodye</a> of Gregorye Arthure
Fyrst Earle of Dorincourt <a id="anote-56-23" href="#note-56-23">allsoe</a> of Alisone Hildegarde
hys wyfe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I whisper?&rdquo; inquired his lordship, <a id="anote-56-25" href="#note-56-25">devoured</a>
by curiosity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said his grandfather.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some of your ancestors,&rdquo; answered the Earl, &ldquo;who
lived a few hundred years ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Lord Fauntleroy, regarding them
with respect, &ldquo;perhaps I got my spelling from them.&rdquo;
And then he proceeded to find his place in the <a id="anote-56-33" href="#note-56-33">church service.</a>
When the music began, he stood up and looked
across at his mother, smiling. He was very fond
of music, and his mother and he often sang together,
so he joined in with the rest, his pure, sweet, high
voice rising as clear as the song of a bird. He quite
forgot himself in his pleasure in it. The Earl forgot
himself a little too, as he sat in his <a id="anote-56-40" href="#note-56-40">curtain-shielded</a>
corner of the pew and watched the boy. His mother,
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
as she looked at him across the church, felt a thrill
pass through her heart, and a prayer rose in it too;
a prayer that the pure, simple happiness of his childish
soul might last, and that the strange, great fortune
which had fallen to him might bring no wrong or
evil with it. There were many soft anxious thoughts
in her tender heart in those new days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Ceddie!&rdquo; she had said to him the evening
before, as she hung over him in saying good-night,
before he went away; &ldquo;Oh, Ceddie, dear, I wish for
your sake I was very clever and could say a great
many wise things! But only be good, dear, only be
brave, only be kind and true always, and then you
will never hurt any one so long as you live, and
you may help many, and the big world may be better
because my little child was born.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And on his return to the Castle, Fauntleroy had
repeated her words to his grandfather.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I thought about you when she said that,&rdquo;
he ended; &ldquo;and I told her that was the way the
world was because you had lived, and I was going
to try if I could be like you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what did she say to that?&rdquo; asked his lordship,
a trifle uneasily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She said that was right, and we must always
look for good in people and try to be like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was this the old man remembered as
he glanced through the divided folds of the red curtain
of his pew to where his son&rsquo;s wife sat.
</p>

<p>
As they came out of the church, many of those
who had attended the service stood waiting to see
them pass. As they neared the gate, a man who
stood with his hat in his hand made a step forward
and then hesitated. He was a middle-aged farmer,
with a <a id="anote-57-35" href="#note-57-35">careworn</a> face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Higgins,&rdquo; said the Earl.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy turned quickly to look at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;is it Mr. Higgins?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Earl dryly; &ldquo;and I suppose
he came to take a look at his new landlord.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; said the man, his sunburned
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
face reddening. &ldquo;Mr. Newick told me his young
lordship was kind enough to speak for me, and I
thought I&rsquo;d like to say a word of thanks, if I might
be allowed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he felt some wonder when he saw what
a little fellow it was who had innocently done so
much for him, and who stood there looking up just
as one of his own less fortunate children might have
done&mdash;apparently not realising his own importance in
the least.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great deal to thank your lordship for,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;a great deal. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy; &ldquo;I only wrote the letter.
It was my grandfather who did it. But you know
how he is about always being good to everybody. Is
Mrs. Higgins well now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Higgins looked <a id="anote-58-17" href="#note-58-17">a trifle taken aback.</a> He also
was somewhat startled at hearing his noble landlord
presented in the character of a benevolent being, full
of engaging qualities.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;well, yes, your lordship,&rdquo; he stammered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy. &ldquo;My grandfather
was very sorry about your children having the
scarlet fever, and so was I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, Higgins,&rdquo; <a id="anote-58-25" href="#note-58-25">broke in</a> the Earl with a
fine grim smile; &ldquo;you people have been mistaken in
me. Lord Fauntleroy understands me. Get into the
carriage, Fauntleroy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Fauntleroy jumped in, and the carriage rolled
away down the green lane, and even when it turned
the corner into the high road, the Earl was still
grimly smiling.
</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-2-8">
CHAPTER VIII.<br />
LEARNING TO RIDE.
</h3>

<p>
Lord Dorincourt had occasion to wear his grim
smile many a time as the days passed by. Indeed,
as his acquaintance with his grandson progressed, he
wore the smile so often that there were moments
when it almost lost its grimness. There is no denying
<a id="page-59" class="pagenum" title="59"></a>
that before Lord Fauntleroy had appeared on the
scene, the old man had been growing very tired of his
loneliness and his gout and his seventy years, but
when he saw the lad, fortunately for the little fellow,
the secret pride of the grandfather was gratified at
the outset. And then when he heard the lad talk,
and saw what a well-bred little fellow he was, notwithstanding
his boyish ignorance of all that his new
position meant, the old Earl liked his grandson more,
and actually began to find himself rather entertained.
It had amused him to give into those childish hands
the power to bestow a benefit on poor Higgins. Then
it had gratified him to drive to church with Cedric
and to see the excitement and interest caused by the
arrival. My lord of Dorincourt was an arrogant old
man, proud of his name, proud of his rank, and
therefore proud to show the world that at last the
House of Dorincourt had an heir who was worthy of
the position he was to fill.
</p>

<p>
The morning the new pony had been tried the
Earl had been so pleased that he had almost forgotten
his gout. When the groom had brought out
the pretty creature, which <a id="anote-59-23" href="#note-59-23">arched</a> its brown glossy
neck and tossed its fine head in the sun, the Earl
had sat at the open window of the library and had
looked on while Fauntleroy took his first riding lesson.
He wondered if the boy would show signs of timidity.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy mounted in great delight. He had
never been on a pony before, and he was in the
highest spirits. Wilkins, the groom, led the animal
by the bridle up and down before the library window.
</p>

<p>
After a few minutes Fauntleroy spoke to his
grandfather&mdash;watching him from the window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go myself?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;and can&rsquo;t I
go faster?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His lordship made a sign to Wilkins, who at the
signal brought up his own horse and mounted it and
took Fauntleroy&rsquo;s pony by the <a id="anote-59-38" href="#note-59-38">leading-rein.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;let him trot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The next few minutes were rather exciting to
the small equestrian. He found that trotting was
<a id="page-60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a>
not so easy as walking, and the faster the pony
trotted, the less easy it was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It j-jolts a g-goo-good deal&mdash;do-doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he
said to Wilkins. &ldquo;D-does it j-jolt y-you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; answered Wilkins. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get
used to it in time. Rise in your stirrups.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ri-rising all the t-time,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy.
</p>

<p>
He was both rising and falling rather uncomfortably
and with many shakes and bounces. He was
out of breath, but he held on with all his might, and
sat as straight as he could. The Earl could see that
from his window. When the riders came back within
speaking distance, after they had been hidden by the
trees a few minutes, Fauntleroy&rsquo;s hat was off, his
cheeks were like poppies, and his lips were <a id="anote-60-15" href="#note-60-15">set,</a> but
he was still trotting manfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop a minute!&rdquo; said his grandfather. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
your hat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wilkins touched his. &ldquo;It fell off, your lordship,&rdquo;
he said, with evident enjoyment. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t let me
stop to pick it up, my lord.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; said the Earl to Fauntleroy. <a id="anote-60-22" href="#note-60-22">&ldquo;Want</a>
to get off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It jolts you more than you think it will,&rdquo; admitted
his young lordship frankly. &ldquo;And it tires you
a little too; but I don&rsquo;t want to get off. I want to
learn how. As soon as I&rsquo;ve got my breath I want to
go back for the hat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The cleverest person in the world, if he had
undertaken to teach Fauntleroy how to please the
old man who watched him, could not have taught
him anything which would have succeeded better.
As the pony trotted off again toward the avenue, a
faint colour crept up in the fierce old face, and the
eyes, under the shaggy brows, gleamed with a pleasure
such as his lordship had scarcely expected to know
again. And he sat and watched quite eagerly until
the sound of the horses&rsquo; hoofs returned. When they
did come, which was after some time, they came at
a faster pace. Fauntleroy&rsquo;s hat was still off, Wilkins
was carrying it for him; his cheeks were redder than
<a id="page-61" class="pagenum" title="61"></a>
before, and his hair was flying about his ears, but
he came at quite a brisk canter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; <a id="anote-61-3" href="#note-61-3">he panted,</a> as they drew up, &ldquo;I c-cantered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He and Wilkins and the pony were close friends
after that. Scarcely a day passed on which the country
people did not see them out together, cantering gaily
on the highroad or through the green lanes. The
children in the cottages would run to the door to
look at the proud little brown pony with the gallant
little figure sitting so straight in the saddle, and the
young lord would <a id="anote-61-11" href="#note-61-11">snatch off</a> his cap and swing it at
them, and shout, &ldquo;Hallo! Good morning!&rdquo; in a very
unlordly manner, though with great heartiness. Sometimes
he would stop and talk with the children, and
once Wilkins came back to the Castle with a story
of how Fauntleroy had insisted on dismounting near
the village school, so that a boy who was lame and
tired might ride home on his pony.
</p>

<p>
<a id="anote-61-19" href="#note-61-19">&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m blessed,&rdquo;</a> said Wilkins, in telling the
story at the stables,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if he&rsquo;d hear of
anything else! He wouldn&rsquo;t let me get down, because
he said the boy mightn&rsquo;t feel comfortable on
a big horse. An&rsquo; <a id="anote-61-23" href="#note-61-23">ses</a> he, &rsquo;Wilkins,&rsquo; ses he, &rsquo;that boy&rsquo;s
lame and I&rsquo;m not, and I want to talk to him too.&rsquo;
And up the lad has to get, and my lord <a id="anote-61-25" href="#note-61-25">trudges</a> alongside
of him with his hands in his pockets. And when
we come to the cottage, an&rsquo; the boy&rsquo;s mother comes
out to see <a id="anote-61-28" href="#note-61-28">what&rsquo;s up,</a> <a id="anote-61-28-2" href="#note-61-28-2">he whips off</a> his cap an&rsquo; ses he,
&rsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought your son home, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; ses he, &rsquo;because
his leg hurt him, and I don&rsquo;t think that stick is
enough for him to lean on; and I&rsquo;m going to ask my
grandfather to have a pair of crutches made for him.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When the Earl heard the story, he was not angry,
as Wilkins had been half afraid that he would be;
on the contrary, he laughed outright, and called Fauntleroy
up to him, and made him tell all about the
matter from beginning to end, and then he laughed
again. And actually, a few days later, the Dorincourt
carriage stopped in the green lane before the cottage
where the lame boy lived, and Fauntleroy jumped out
and walked up to the door, carrying a pair of strong,
<a id="page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
light, new crutches, and presented them to Mrs. Hartle
(the lame boy&rsquo;s name was Hartle) with these words:
&ldquo;My grandfather&rsquo;s compliments, and if you please, these
are for your boy, and we hope he will get better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said your compliments,&rdquo; he explained to the
Earl when he returned to the carriage. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
tell me to, but I thought perhaps you forgot. That
was right, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the Earl laughed again, and did not say it
was not. In fact, the two were becoming more intimate
every day, and every day Fauntleroy&rsquo;s faith
in his lordship&rsquo;s benevolence and virtue increased. He
had no doubt whatever that his grandfather was the
most amiable and generous of elderly gentlemen. Certainly,
he himself found his wishes gratified almost
before they were uttered; and such gifts and pleasures
were lavished upon him, that he was sometimes almost
bewildered by his own possessions. Perhaps, notwithstanding
his sweet nature, he might have been somewhat
spoiled by it, if it had not been for the hours
he spent with his mother at Court Lodge. That &ldquo;best
friend&rdquo; of his watched over him very <a id="anote-62-22" href="#note-62-22">closely</a> and tenderly.
The two had many long talks together, and
he never went back to the Castle with her kisses on
his cheeks without carrying in his heart some simple,
pure words worth remembering.
</p>

<p>
There was one thing, it is true, which puzzled
the little fellow very much. He thought over the
mystery of it much oftener than any one supposed;
even his mother did not know how often he pondered
on it; the Earl for a long time never suspected that
he did so at all. But being quick to observe, the
little boy could not help wondering why it was that
his mother and grandfather never seemed to meet. He
had noticed that they never did meet. And yet, every
day, fruit and flowers were sent to Court Lodge from
the hot-houses at the Castle. But the one virtuous
action of the Earl&rsquo;s <a id="anote-62-38" href="#note-62-38">which had set him upon the pinnacle of perfection</a>
in Cedric&rsquo;s eyes, was what he had
done soon after that first Sunday when Mrs. Errol
had walked home from church unattended. About a
<a id="page-63" class="pagenum" title="63"></a>
week later, when Cedric was going one day to visit
his mother, he found at the door, instead of the large
carriage and prancing pair, a pretty little <a id="anote-63-3" href="#note-63-3">brougham</a>
and a handsome bay horse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a present from you to your mother,&rdquo;
the Earl said <a id="anote-63-6" href="#note-63-6">abruptly.</a> &ldquo;She cannot go walking
about the country. She needs a carriage. The man
who drives will take charge of it. It is a present
from <em>you</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy&rsquo;s delight could but feebly express
itself. He could scarcely contain himself until he
reached the lodge. His mother was gathering roses
in the garden. He flung himself out of the little
brougham and flew to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dearest!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;could you believe it? This
is yours! He says it is a present from me. It is
your own carriage to drive everywhere in!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was so happy that she did not know what
to say. She could not have borne to spoil his pleasure
by refusing to accept the gift, even though
it came from the man who chose to consider himself
her enemy. She was obliged to step into the
carriage, roses and all, and let herself be taken for
a drive, while Fauntleroy told her stories of his
grandfather&rsquo;s goodness and amiability. They were
such innocent stories that sometimes she could not
help laughing a little, and then she would draw her
little boy closer to her side and kiss him, feeling
glad that he could see only good in the old man who
had so few friends.
</p>

<p>
The very next day after that, Fauntleroy wrote
to Mr. Hobbs. He wrote quite a long letter, and
after the first copy was written, he brought it to his
grandfather to be inspected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so uncertain about the
spelling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These were the last lines:
</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>
&ldquo;I should like to see you and I wish dearest could live at
the castle but I am very happy when I <a id="anote-63-39" href="#note-63-39">dont</a> miss her too much
and I love my <a id="anote-63-40" href="#note-63-40">granfarther</a> every one does <a id="anote-63-40-2" href="#note-63-40-2">plees</a> write soon

&ldquo;Cedric Errol.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<a id="page-64" class="pagenum" title="64"></a>
&ldquo;Do you miss your mother very much?&rdquo; asked
the Earl when he had finished reading this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy, &ldquo;I miss her all the time.
And when I miss her very much, I go and look
out of my window to where I see her light shine for
me every night through an open place in the trees.
It is a long way off, but she puts it in her window
as soon as it is dark and I can see it twinkle far
away, and I know what it says.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does it say?&rdquo; asked my lord.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It says, &rsquo;Good-night, God keep you all the
night!&rsquo;&mdash;just what she used to say when we were
together. Every night she used to say that to me,
and every morning she said, &rsquo;God bless you all the
day!&rsquo; So you see I am quite safe all the time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite, I have no doubt,&rdquo; said his lordship
dryly. And he drew down his beetling eyebrows
and looked at the little boy so fixedly and so long
that Fauntleroy wondered what he could be thinking
of.

THE POOR COTTAGES.

<p>
The fact was, his lordship the Earl of Dorincourt
thought in those days of many things of which
he had never thought before, and all his thoughts
were in one way or another connected with his grandson.
His pride was the strongest part of his nature,
and the boy gratified it at every point. Through this
pride he began to find a new interest in life. He
began to take pleasure in showing his heir to the
world. The world had known of his disappointment
in his sons; so there was an agreeable touch of triumph
in exhibiting this new Lord Fauntleroy, who could
disappoint no one. He made plans for his future.
Sometimes in this new interest he forgot his gout,
and after a while his doctor was surprised to find
this noble patient&rsquo;s health growing better than he
had expected it ever would be again. Perhaps the
Earl grew better because the time did not pass so
<a id="page-65" class="pagenum" title="65"></a>
slowly for him, and he had something to think of
besides his pains and infirmities.
</p>

<p>
One fine morning, people were amazed to see
little Lord Fauntleroy riding his pony with another
companion than Wilkins. This new companion rode
a tall, powerful gray horse, and was no other than
the Earl himself.
</p>

<p>
And in their rides together through the green
lanes and pretty country roads, the two riders became
more intimate than ever. And gradually the old man
heard a great deal about &ldquo;Dearest&rdquo; and her life. As
Fauntleroy trotted by the big horse he chatted gaily.
There could not well have been a brighter little comrade,
his nature was so happy. The Earl often was
silent, listening and watching the joyous, glowing
face. Sometimes he would tell his young companion
to set the pony off at a gallop, and when the little
fellow <a id="anote-65-18" href="#note-65-18">dashed off,</a> sitting so straight and fearless, he
would watch the boy with a gleam of pride and
pleasure in his eyes; and Fauntleroy, when, after
<a id="anote-65-21" href="#note-65-21">such a dash,</a> he came back waving his cap with a
laughing shout, always felt that he and his grandfather
were very good friends indeed.
</p>

<p>
One thing that the Earl discovered was that his
son&rsquo;s wife did not lead an idle life. It was not long
before he learned that the poor people knew her very
well indeed. When there was sickness or sorrow or
poverty in any house, the little brougham often stood
before the door.
</p>

<p>
It had not displeased the Earl to find that the
mother of his heir had a beautiful young face and
looked as much like a lady as if she had been a
duchess, and in one way it did not displease him to
know that she was popular and beloved by the poor.
And yet he was often conscious of a hard, jealous
pang when he saw how she filled her child&rsquo;s heart
and how the boy clung to her as his best beloved.
The old man would have desired to stand first himself
and have no rival.
</p>

<p>
He felt it to be almost incredible that he, who
had never really loved any one in his life, should
<a id="page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>
find himself growing so fond of this little fellow,&mdash;as
without doubt he was. At first he had only been
pleased and proud of Cedric&rsquo;s beauty and bravery, but
there was something more than pride in his feeling
now. He laughed a grim, dry laugh all to himself
sometimes, when he thought how he liked to have the
boy near him, how he liked to hear his voice, and how
in secret he really wished to be liked and thought
well of by his small grandson.
</p>

<p>
It was only about a week after that ride when,
after a visit to his mother, Fauntleroy came into
the library with a troubled, thoughtful face. He sat
down in that high-backed chair in which he had sat
on the evening of his arrival, and for a while he
looked at the embers on the hearth. The Earl watched
him in silence, wondering what was coming. It was
evident that Cedric had something <a id="anote-66-17" href="#note-66-17">on his mind.</a> At
last he looked up &ldquo;Does Newick know all about the
people?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is his business to know about them,&rdquo; said
<a id="pl-66-21"></a>his lordship. <a id="anote-66-21" href="#note-66-21">&ldquo;Been neglecting it&mdash;has he?&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
Contradictory as it may seem, there was nothing
which entertained and edified him more than the little
fellow&rsquo;s interest in his tenantry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is a place,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy, looking up
at him with wide-open, <a id="anote-66-26" href="#note-66-26">horror-stricken</a> eyes&mdash;&ldquo;Dearest
has seen it; it is at the other end of the village.
The houses are close together, and almost falling
down; you can scarcely breathe: and the people are
so poor, and everything is dreadful! The rain comes
in at the roof! Dearest went to see a poor woman
who lived there. The tears ran down her cheeks when
she told me about it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tears had come into his own eyes, but he
smiled through them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told her you didn&rsquo;t know, and I would tell
you,&rdquo; he said. He jumped down and came and leaned
against the Earl&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;You can make it all
right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just as you made it all right for
Higgins. You always make it all right for everybody.
<a id="page-67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a>
I told her you would, and that Newick must
have forgotten to tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl looked down at the hand on his knee.
Newick had not forgotten to tell him; in fact, Newick
had spoken to him more than once of the desperate
condition of the end of the village known as Earl&rsquo;s
Court. Mr. Mordaunt had painted it all to him in
the strongest words he could use, and his lordship
had used violent language in response; and, when his
gout had been at the worst, he had said that the
sooner the people of Earl&rsquo;s Court died and were buried
by the parish the better it would be&mdash;and there was
an end of the matter. And yet, as he looked at
the small hand on his knee, and from the small
hand to the honest, earnest, frank-eyed face, he was
actually ashamed both of Earl&rsquo;s Court and of himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you want to make a builder
of model cottages of me, do you?&rdquo; And he positively
put his own hand upon the childish one and
stroked it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those must be pulled down,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy,
with great eagerness. &ldquo;Dearest says so. Let us&mdash;let
us go and have them pulled down to-morrow.
The people will be so glad when they see you! They&rsquo;ll
know you have come to help them!&rdquo; And his eyes
shone like stars in his glowing face.
</p>

<p>
The Earl rose from his chair and put his hand
on the child&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Let us go out and take
our walk on the terrace,&rdquo; he said, with a short laugh;
&ldquo;and we can talk it over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And though he laughed two or three times again,
as they walked to and fro on the broad stone terrace,
where they walked together almost every fine evening,
he seemed to be thinking of something which did not
displease him, and still he kept his hand on his small
companion&rsquo;s shoulder.

CHAPTER X.<br />
THE EARL ALARMED.
</h3>

<p>
The truth was that Mrs. Errol had found a great
many sad things in the course of her work among
the poor of the little village that appeared so picturesque
when it was seen from the moor-sides.
Everything was not as picturesque when seen near
by, as it looked from a distance. She had found
idleness and poverty and ignorance where there should
have been comfort and industry. And she had discovered,
after a while, that Erlesboro was considered
to be the worst village in that part of the country.
</p>

<p>
As to Earl&rsquo;s Court, it was a disgrace, with its
dilapidated houses and miserable, careless, sickly people.
When first Mrs. Errol went to the place, it made her
shudder. And a bold thought came into her wise
little mother-heart. Gradually she had begun to see,
as had others, that it had been her boy&rsquo;s good fortune
to please the Earl very much, and that he would
scarcely be likely to be denied anything for which
he expressed a desire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Earl would give him anything,&rdquo; she said
to Mr. Mordaunt. &ldquo;He would indulge his every whim.
Why should not that indulgence be used for the
good of others? It is for me to see that this shall
come to pass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She knew she could trust the kind, childish
heart; so she told the little fellow the story of Earl&rsquo;s
Court, feeling sure that he would speak of it to his
grandfather, and hoping that some good results
would follow.
</p>

<p>
And strange as it appeared to every one, good
results did follow. The fact was that the strongest
power to influence the Earl was his grandson&rsquo;s perfect
confidence in him&mdash;the fact that Cedric always
believed that his grandfather was going to do what
was right and generous. He could not quite make
up his mind to let him discover that he had no inclination
to be generous at all, and so after some
reflection, he sent for Newick, and had quite a long
interview with him on the subject of the Court, and
<a id="page-69" class="pagenum" title="69"></a>
it was decided that the wretched hovels should be
pulled down and new houses should be built.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is Lord Fauntleroy who insists on it,&rdquo; he said
dryly; &ldquo;he thinks it will improve the property. You
can tell the tenants that it&rsquo;s his idea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Of course, both the country people and the town
people heard of the proposed improvement. At first,
many of them would not believe it; but when a small
army of workmen arrived and commenced pulling down
the <a id="anote-69-10" href="#note-69-10">crazy,</a> squalid cottages, people began to understand
that little Lord Fauntleroy had done them a good turn
again, and that through his innocent interference the
scandal of Earl&rsquo;s Court had at last been removed.
</p>

<p>
When the cottages were being built, the lad and
his grandfather used to ride over to Earl&rsquo;s Court together
to look at them, and Fauntleroy was full of
interest. He would dismount from his pony and go
and make acquaintance with the workmen, asking
them questions about building and bricklaying and
telling them things about America.
</p>

<p>
When he left them, the workmen used <a id="anote-69-21" href="#note-69-21">to talk him over</a>
among themselves, and laugh at his odd,
innocent speeches; but they liked him, and liked to
see him stand among them, talking away, with his
hands in his pockets, his hat pushed back on his
curls, and his small face full of eagerness. And they
would go home and tell their wives about him, and
the women would tell each other, and so it came about
that almost every one talked of, or knew some story
of, little Lord Fauntleroy; and gradually almost every
one knew that the &ldquo;wicked Earl&rdquo; had found something
he cared for at last&mdash;something which had touched and
even warmed his hard, bitter old heart.
</p>

<p>
But no one knew quite how much it had been
warmed, and how day by day the old man found himself
caring more and more for the child, who was the
only creature that had ever trusted him.
</p>

<p>
He never spoke to any one else of his feeling for
Cedric; when he spoke of him to others it was always
with the same grim smile. But Fauntleroy soon knew
that his grandfather loved him and always liked him
<a id="page-70" class="pagenum" title="70"></a>
to be near&mdash;near to his chair if they were in the
library, opposite to him at table, or by his side when
he rode or drove or took his evening walk on the
broad terrace.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; Cedric said once looking up
from his book as he lay on the rug, &ldquo;do you remember
what I said to you that first night about our being
good companions? I don&rsquo;t think any people could be
better friends than we are, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are pretty good companions, I should say,&rdquo;
replied his lordship. &ldquo;Come here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy <a id="anote-70-12" href="#note-70-12">scrambled up</a> and went to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there anything you want,&rdquo; the Earl asked;
&ldquo;anything you have not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little fellow&rsquo;s brown eyes fixed themselves
on his grandfather with a rather wistful look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only one thing,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; inquired the Earl.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy was silent a second. He had not
thought matters over to himself so long for nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; my lord repeated.
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is Dearest,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
The old Earl winced a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you see her almost every day,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Is not that enough?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I used to see her all the time,&rdquo; said Fauntleroy.
&ldquo;She used to kiss me when I went to sleep at night,
and in the morning she was always there, and we
could tell each other things without waiting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old eyes and the young ones looked into
each other through a moment of silence. Then the
Earl knitted his brows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you <em>never</em> forget about your mother?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Fauntleroy, &ldquo;never; and she never
forgets about me. I shouldn&rsquo;t forget about <em>you</em>, you
know, if I didn&rsquo;t live with you. I should think about
you all the more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said the Earl, after looking at
him a moment longer, &ldquo;I believe you would!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The jealous pang that came when the boy spoke
<a id="page-71" class="pagenum" title="71"></a>
so of his mother seemed even stronger than it had
been before&mdash;it was stronger because of this old man&rsquo;s
increasing affection for the boy.
</p>

<p>
But it was not long before he had other pangs,
so much harder to face that he almost forgot, for the
time, he had ever hated his son&rsquo;s wife at all. And
in a strange and startling way it happened. One
evening, just before the Earl&rsquo;s Court cottages were
completed, there was a grand dinner party at Dorincourt.
There had not been such a party at the Castle
for a long time. A few days before it took place,
<a id="anote-71-12" href="#note-71-12">Sir</a> Harry Lorridaile and Lady Lorridaile, who was
the Earl&rsquo;s only sister, actually came for a visit&mdash;a
thing which caused the greatest excitement in the
village <a id="anote-71-15" href="#note-71-15">and set Mrs. Dibble&rsquo;s shop-bell tinkling madly again,</a>
because it was well known that Lady Lorridaile
had only been to Dorincourt once since her marriage,
thirty-five years before. She was a handsome old lady
with white curls and <a id="anote-71-19" href="#note-71-19">dimpled, peachy cheeks,</a> and she
was as good as gold, but she had never approved of her
brother any more than did the rest of the world, and
having a strong will of her own and not being at all
afraid to speak her mind frankly, she had, after several
lively quarrels with his lordship, seen very little of
him since her young days.
</p>

<p>
Not only the poor people and farmers heard about
little Lord Fauntleroy; others knew of him. He was
talked about so much and there were so many stories
of him&mdash;of his beauty, his sweet temper, his popularity,
and his growing influence over the Earl his grandfather&mdash;that
rumours of him reached the gentry at
their country places and he was heard of in more than
one county of England.
</p>

<p>
And so by degrees Lady Lorridaile, too, heard
of the child; she heard about Higgins, and the lame
boy, and the cottages at Earl&rsquo;s Court, and a score of
other things,&mdash;and she began to wish to see the little
fellow. And just as she was wondering how it might
be brought about, to her utter astonishment, she received
a letter from her brother inviting her to come
with her husband to Dorincourt.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-72" class="pagenum" title="72"></a>
&ldquo;It seems incredible!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I have
heard it said that the child has worked miracles, and
I begin to believe it. They say my brother adores
the boy and can scarcely endure to have him out of
sight. And he is so proud of him! Actually, I believe
he wants to show him to us.&rdquo; And she accepted
the invitation at once.
</p>

<p>
When she reached Dorincourt Castle with Sir
Harry, it was late in the afternoon, and she went to
her room at once before seeing her brother. Having
dressed for dinner she entered the drawing-room. The
Earl was there standing near the fire and looking very
tall and imposing; and at his side stood a little boy
in black velvet, and a large <a id="anote-72-14" href="#note-72-14">Vandyke collar</a> of rich
lace&mdash;a little fellow whose round bright face was so
handsome, and who turned upon her such beautiful,
candid brown eyes, that she almost uttered an exclamation
of pleasure and surprise at the sight.
</p>

<p>
As she shook hands with the Earl, she called him
by the name she had not used since her girl-hood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What, Molyneux,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is this the child?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Constantia,&rdquo; answered the Earl, &ldquo;this is
the boy. Fauntleroy, this is your grand-aunt, Lady
Lorridaile.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, grand-aunt?&rdquo; said Fauntleroy.
</p>

<p>
Lady Lorridaile put her hand on his shoulder, and
after looking down into his upraised face a few seconds,
kissed him warmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am your Aunt Constantia,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I
loved your poor papa, and you are very like him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It makes me glad when I am told I am like
him,&rdquo; answered Fauntleroy, &ldquo;because it seems as if
every one liked him,&mdash;just like Dearest, <a id="anote-72-33" href="#note-72-33">eszackly,</a>&mdash;Aunt
Constantia,&rdquo; (adding the two words after a second&rsquo;s
pause).
</p>

<p>
Lady Lorridaile was delighted. She bent and
kissed him again, and from that moment they were
warm friends.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Molyneux,&rdquo; she said aside to the Earl afterwards,
&ldquo;it could not possibly be better than this!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; answered his lordship dryly. &ldquo;He
<a id="page-73" class="pagenum" title="73"></a>
is a fine little fellow. We are great friends. He
believes me to be the most charming and sweet-tempered
of philanthropists. I will confess to you, Constantia,&mdash;as
you would find it out if I did not,&mdash;that I am
in some slight danger of becoming rather an old fool
about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does his mother think of you?&rdquo; asked Lady
Lorridaile, with her usual straightforwardness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have not asked her,&rdquo; answered the Earl, slightly
scowling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lady Lorridaile, &ldquo;I will be frank
with you at the outset, Molyneux, and tell you I don&rsquo;t
approve of your <a id="anote-73-13" href="#note-73-13">course,</a> and that it is my intention
to call on Mrs. Errol as soon as possible; so if you
wish to quarrel with me, you had better mention it
at once. What I hear of the young creature makes
me quite sure that her child owes her everything.
We were told even at Lorridaile Park that your poorer
tenants adore her already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They adore <em>him</em>,&rdquo; said the Earl, nodding towards
Fauntleroy. &ldquo;As to Mrs. Errol, you&rsquo;ll find her a pretty
little woman. I&rsquo;m rather in debt to her for giving
some of her beauty to the boy, and you can go to
see her if you like. All I ask is that she will remain
at Court Lodge and that you will not ask me to go
and see her,&rdquo; and he scowled a little again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t hate her as much as he used to,
that is plain enough to me,&rdquo; her ladyship said to Sir
Harry afterwards. &ldquo;And he is a changed man <a id="anote-73-30" href="#note-73-30">in a measure,</a>
and, incredible as it may seem, Harry, it is
my opinion that he is being made into a human being,
through nothing more or less than his affection for
that innocent, affectionate little fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The very next day she went to call upon Mrs.
Errol. When she returned, she said to her brother:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Molyneux, she is the loveliest little woman I
ever saw! She has a voice like a silver bell, and
you may thank her for making the boy what he is.
She has given him more than her beauty, and you
make a great mistake in not persuading her to come
<a id="page-74" class="pagenum" title="74"></a>
and take charge of you. I shall invite her to Lorridaile.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not leave the boy,&rdquo; replied the Earl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must have the boy too,&rdquo; said Lady Lorridaile,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
But she knew Fauntleroy would not be given up
to her, and each day she saw more clearly <a id="anote-74-7" href="#note-74-7">how closely those two had grown to each other,</a>
and how all the
proud, grim old man&rsquo;s ambition and hope and love
centred themselves in the child, and how the warm,
innocent nature returned his affection with most perfect
trust and good faith.
</p>

<p>
She knew, too, that the prime reason for the
great dinner party was the Earl&rsquo;s secret desire to
show the world his grandson and heir. Perhaps there
was not one person who accepted the invitation without
feeling some curiosity about little Lord Fauntleroy,
and wondering if he would be on view.
</p>

<p>
And when the time came he was on view.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The lad has good manners,&rdquo; said the Earl.
&ldquo;He will be in no one&rsquo;s way. He can actually
answer when he&rsquo;s spoken to, and be silent when he
is not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But he was not allowed to be silent very long.
Every one had something to say to him. The fact
was they wished to make him talk. The ladies petted
him and asked him questions, and the men asked him
questions too, and joked with him, as the men on the
steamer had done when he crossed the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
But though he was talked to so much, as the
Earl had said, he was in no one&rsquo;s way. He could be
quiet and listen when others talked, and so no one
found him tiresome.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham had been expected to arrive in the
afternoon, but, strange to say, he was late. Such a
thing had really never been known to happen before
during all the years in which he had been a visitor
at Dorincourt Castle. He was so late that the guests
were on the point of rising to go in to dinner when
he arrived. When he approached his host, the Earl
regarded him with amazement. He looked as if he
<a id="page-75" class="pagenum" title="75"></a>
had been hurried or agitated; his dry, keen old face
was actually pale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was detained,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice to the
Earl, &ldquo;by&mdash;an extraordinary event.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was as unlike the <a id="anote-75-5" href="#note-75-5">methodic</a> old lawyer to be
agitated by anything as it was to be late, but it was
evident that he had been disturbed. At dinner he ate
scarcely anything, and two or three times, when he
was spoken to, he started as if his thoughts were far
away. At dessert, when Fauntleroy came in, he looked
at him more than once, nervously and uneasily. Fauntleroy
noted the look and wondered at it. He and Mr.
Havisham were on friendly terms, and they usually
exchanged smiles.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer seemed to have forgotten to smile that
evening.
</p>

<p>
He did not exactly know how the long, superb
dinner ended. He sat through it as if he were in a
dream, and several times he saw the Earl glance at
him in surprise.
</p>

<p>
But it was over at last, and the gentlemen joined
the ladies in the drawing-room. They found Fauntleroy
sitting on a sofa with Miss Vivian Herbert,&mdash;the
great beauty of the last London season; they had
been looking at some pictures, and he was thanking
his companion, as the door opened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <a id="anote-75-27" href="#note-75-27">ever so much</a> obliged to you for being so
kind to me!&rdquo; he was saying; &ldquo;I never was at a party
before, and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed myself so much!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had enjoyed himself so much that his eyelids
began to droop. He was quite sure he was not going
to sleep, but there was a large, yellow satin cushion
behind him and his head sank against it, and after a
while his eyelids drooped for the last time.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
No sooner had the last guest left the room, than
Mr. Havisham turned from his place by the fire, and
stepped nearer the sofa, where he stood looking down
at the sleeping occupant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Havisham,&rdquo; said the Earl&rsquo;s harsh voice
behind him. &ldquo;What is it? It is evident something
<a id="page-76" class="pagenum" title="76"></a>
has happened. What was the extraordinary event, if
I may ask?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham turned from the sofa, still rubbing
his chin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was bad news,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;distressing
news, my lord&mdash;the worst of news. I am sorry to be
the bearer of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl had been uneasy for some time during
the evening, as he glanced at Mr. Havisham, and
when he was uneasy he was always ill-tempered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you look so at the boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed
irritably. &ldquo;You have been looking at him all the
evening as if&mdash;. What has your news to do with Lord
Fauntleroy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham, &ldquo;I will waste no
words. My news has everything to do with Lord
Fauntleroy. And if we are to believe it&mdash;it is not
Lord Fauntleroy who lies sleeping before us, but only
the son of Captain Errol. And the present Lord
Fauntleroy is the son of your son Bevis, and is at
this moment in a lodging-house in London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl <a id="anote-76-22" href="#note-76-22">clutched</a> the arms of his chair with both
his hands until the veins stood out upon them; the
veins stood out on his forehead too; his fierce old face
was almost livid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;You are
mad! Whose lie is this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it is a lie,&rdquo; answered Mr. Havisham, &ldquo;it is
painfully like the truth. A woman came to my <a id="anote-76-29" href="#note-76-29">chambers</a>
this morning. She said your son Bevis married
her six years ago in London. She showed me her
marriage certificate. They quarrelled a year after the
marriage, and he paid her to keep away from him.
She has a son five years old. She is an American
of the lower classes,&mdash;an ignorant person,&mdash;and until
lately she did not fully understand what her son could
claim. She consulted a lawyer, and found out that
the boy was really Lord Fauntleroy and the heir to
the earldom of Dorincourt; and she, of course, insists
on his claims being acknowledged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-77" class="pagenum" title="77"></a>
The handsome, grim old face was ghastly. A
bitter smile fixed itself upon it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should refuse to believe a word of it,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;if it were not such <a id="anote-77-4" href="#note-77-4">a low, scoundrelly piece of business</a>
that it becomes quite possible in connection
with the name of my son Bevis. It is quite like
Bevis. He was always a disgrace to us. The woman
is an ignorant, vulgar person, you say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am obliged to admit that she can scarcely spell
her own name,&rdquo; answered the lawyer. &ldquo;She cares for
nothing but the money. She is very handsome in a
coarse way, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The <a id="anote-77-13" href="#note-77-13">fastidious</a> old lawyer ceased speaking and
gave a sort of shudder.
</p>

<p>
The veins on the old Earl&rsquo;s forehead stood out
like purple cords. Something else stood out upon it
too&mdash;cold <a id="anote-77-17" href="#note-77-17">drops of moisture.</a> He took out his handkerchief
and swept them away. His smile grew even
more bitter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I objected to&mdash;to the other
woman, the mother of this child&rdquo; (pointing to the
sleeping form on the sofa); &ldquo;I refused to recognize
her. And yet she could spell her own name. I suppose
this is retribution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he sprang up from his chair and began
to walk up and down the room. Fierce and terrible
words poured forth from his lips. His rage and hatred
and cruel disappointment shook him as a storm
shakes a tree.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I might have known it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They were
a disgrace to me from their first hour! I hated them
both; and they hated me! Bevis was the worse of
the two. I will not believe this yet though! I will
contend against it to the last. But it is like Bevis&mdash;it
is like him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then he raged again and asked questions
about the woman, about her proofs, and pacing the
room, turned first white and then purple in his repressed
fury.
</p>

<p>
When at last he had learned all that was to be
told, and knew the worst, Mr. Havisham looked at
<a id="page-78" class="pagenum" title="78"></a>
him with a feeling of anxiety. He looked broken
and haggard and changed. His rages had always
been bad for him, but this one had been worse than
the rest because there had been something more than
rage in it.
</p>

<p>
He came slowly back to the sofa, at last, and
stood near it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If any one had told me I could be fond of a
child,&rdquo; he said, his harsh voice low and unsteady, &ldquo;I
should not have believed them. I always detested
children&mdash;my own more than the rest. I am fond of this
one; he is fond of me&rdquo; (with a bitter smile). &ldquo;I am
not popular; I never was. But he is fond of me. He
never was afraid of me&mdash;he always trusted me. He
would have filled my place better than I have filled
it. I know that. He would have been an honour to
the name.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He bent down and stood a minute or so looking
at the happy, sleeping face. He put up his hand,
pushed the bright hair back from the forehead, and
then turned away and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
When the footman appeared, he pointed to the sofa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take&rdquo;&mdash;he said, and then his voice changed a
little&mdash;&ldquo;take Lord Fauntleroy to his room.&rdquo;
</p>

CHAPTER XI.<br />
ANXIETY IN AMERICA.
</h3>

<p>
When Mr. Hobbs&rsquo;s young friend left him to go
to Dorincourt Castle and become Lord Fauntleroy, and
the grocery-man had time to realise that the Atlantic
Ocean lay between himself and the small companion
who had spent so many agreeable hours in his society,
he began to feel very lonely indeed. At first it seemed
to Mr. Hobbs that Cedric was not really far away,
and would come back again; that some day he would
look up from his paper and see the lad standing in
the doorway, in his white suit and red stockings, and
with his straw hat on the back of his head, and would
hear him say in his cheerful little voice: &ldquo;Hello, Mr.
Hobbs! This is a hot day&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; But as the
<a id="page-79" class="pagenum" title="79"></a>
days passed on and this did not happen, Mr. Hobbs
felt very dull and uneasy. He did not even enjoy
his newspaper as much as he used to. He would take
out his gold watch and open it and stare at the inscription;
&ldquo;From his oldest friend, Lord Fauntleroy,
to Mr. Hobbs. When this you see, remember me.&rdquo;
At night, when the store was closed, he would light
his pipe and walk slowly along until he reached the
house where Cedric had lived, on which there was a
sign <a id="anote-79-10" href="#note-79-10">that read,</a> &ldquo;This House to Let&rdquo;; and he would
stop near it and look up and shake his head, and puff
at his pipe very hard, and after a while walk mournfully
back again.
</p>

<p>
<a id="pl-79-14"></a>This went on for two or three weeks before a
new idea came to him. He would go to see Dick.
He smoked a great many pipes before he arrived at
the conclusion, but finally he did arrive at it. He
would go to see Dick. He knew all about Dick.
Cedric had told him, and his idea was that perhaps
Dick might be some comfort to him in the way of
talking things over.
</p>

<p>
So one day when Dick was very hard at work
blacking a customer&rsquo;s boots, a short, stout man with
a heavy face and a bald head, stared for two or three
minutes at the bootblack&rsquo;s sign, which read:
</p>

<p class="centeru">
&ldquo;Professor Dick Tipton<br />
Can&rsquo;t be beat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stared at it so long that Dick began to take
a lively interest in him, and when he had put the
finishing touch to his customer&rsquo;s boots, he said:
</p>

<p>
<a id="anote-79-31" href="#note-79-31">&ldquo;Want a shine, sir?&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
The stout man came forward deliberately and put
his foot on the <a id="anote-79-33" href="#note-79-33">rest.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Then when Dick <a id="anote-79-35" href="#note-79-35">fell to work,</a> the stout man
looked from Dick to the sign and from the sign to
Dick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From a friend o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo; said Dick,&mdash;&ldquo;a little
feller. He was the best little <a id="anote-79-40" href="#note-79-40">feller</a> ye ever saw.
<a id="page-80" class="pagenum" title="80"></a>
He&rsquo;s in England now. Gone to be one o&rsquo; those
lords.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord&mdash;Lord&mdash;&rdquo; asked Mr. Hobbs, with ponderous
slowness, &ldquo;Lord Fauntleroy&mdash;Goin&rsquo; to be Earl
of Dorincourt!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dick almost dropped his brush.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, <a id="anote-80-7" href="#note-80-7">boss!&rdquo;</a> he <a id="corr-9"></a>exclaimed, &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye know him <a id="anote-80-7-2" href="#note-80-7-2">yerself?&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known him,&rdquo; answered Mr. Hobbs, wiping
his warm forehead, &ldquo;ever since he was born. We were
<a id="anote-80-11" href="#note-80-11">lifetime acquaintances</a>&mdash;that&rsquo;s what <em>we</em> were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It really made him feel quite agitated to speak
of it. He pulled the splendid gold watch out of his
pocket and opened it, and showed the inside of the
case to Dick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;When this you see, remember me,&rsquo;&rdquo; he read.
&ldquo;That was his parting keepsake to me. I&rsquo;d <a id="anote-80-17" href="#note-80-17">ha&rsquo;</a> remembered
him,&rdquo; he went on, shaking his head, &ldquo;if he
hadn&rsquo;t given me a thing. He was a companion as
<em>any</em> man would remember.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It proved that they had so much to say to each
other that it was not possible to say it all at one time,
and so it was agreed that the next night Dick should
make a visit to the store and keep Mr. Hobbs company.
</p>

<p>
This was the beginning of quite a substantial
friendship. When Dick went up to the store, Mr.
Hobbs received him with great hospitality. He gave
him a chair <a id="anote-80-28" href="#note-80-28">tilted</a> against the door, near a barrel of
apples, and after his young visitor was seated, <a id="anote-80-30" href="#note-80-30">he made a jerk at them with the hand</a>
in which he held
his pipe, saying:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Help yerself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then they read, and discussed the British aristocracy;
and Mr. Hobbs smoked his pipe very hard and
shook his head a great deal.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to derive a great deal of comfort from
Dick&rsquo;s visit. Before Dick went home, they had a
supper in the small back room; they had biscuits and
cheese and sardines, and other things out of the store,
and Mr. Hobbs solemnly opened two bottles of <a id="anote-80-40" href="#note-80-40">ginger ale,</a>
and pouring out two glasses, proposed a toast.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-81" class="pagenum" title="81"></a>
<a id="anote-81-1" href="#note-81-1">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to <em>him</em>!&rdquo;</a> he said, lifting his glass, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
may he teach &rsquo;em a lesson&mdash;earls an&rsquo; <a id="anote-81-2" href="#note-81-2">markises</a> an&rsquo;
<a id="anote-81-3" href="#note-81-3">dooks</a> an&rsquo; all!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After that night, the two saw each other often,
and Mr. Hobbs was much more comfortable and less
desolate. They read the <em>Penny Story Gazette</em>, and
many other interesting things, and gained a knowledge
of the habits of <a id="anote-81-8" href="#note-81-8">the nobility and gentry</a> which would
have surprised those despised classes if they had <a id="anote-81-9" href="#note-81-9">realised</a>
it. One day Mr. Hobbs made a pilgrimage to
a book-store down town, for the express purpose of
adding to their library. He went to a clerk and leaned
over the counter to speak to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a book about earls.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the clerk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A book,&rdquo; repeated the grocery-man, &ldquo;about
earls.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said the clerk, looking rather queer,
&ldquo;that we haven&rsquo;t what you want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said Mr. Hobbs, anxiously. &ldquo;Well,
say markises then&mdash;or dooks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know of no such book,&rdquo; answered the clerk.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs was much disturbed. He looked down
on the floor,&mdash;then he looked up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None about female earls?&rdquo; he inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; said the clerk, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hobbs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was just going out of the store, when the
clerk called him back and asked him if a story in
which the nobility were chief characters would do.
Mr. Hobbs said it would&mdash;if he could not get an
entire volume devoted to earls. So the clerk sold him
a book called <a id="anote-81-33" href="#note-81-33"><em>The Tower of London</em>,</a> written by Mr.
Harrison <a id="anote-81-34" href="#note-81-34">Ainsworth,</a> and he carried it home.
</p>

<p>
When Dick came they began to read it. It was
a very wonderful and exciting book, and the scene
was laid in the reign of the famous English queen
who is called by some people <a id="anote-81-38" href="#note-81-38">Bloody Mary.</a> And as
Mr. Hobbs heard of Queen Mary&rsquo;s deeds and the habit
she had of chopping people&rsquo;s heads off, putting them
to the torture, and burning them alive, he became very
<a id="page-82" class="pagenum" title="82"></a>
much excited. He took his pipe out of his mouth and
stared at Dick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, he <a id="anote-82-3" href="#note-82-3">ain&rsquo;t</a> safe!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t safe!
If the women folks can sit up on their thrones an&rsquo;
give the word for things like that to be done, who&rsquo;s
to know what&rsquo;s happening to him this very minute?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, though he looked rather anxious
himself; &ldquo;ye see <a id="anote-82-8" href="#note-82-8">this &rsquo;ere un</a> isn&rsquo;t the one <a id="anote-82-8-2" href="#note-82-8-2">that&rsquo;s bossin&rsquo;</a>
things now. I know her name&rsquo;s Victory, an&rsquo; this
un here in the book,&mdash;her name&rsquo;s Mary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Hobbs, still mopping his
forehead; &ldquo;so it is,&mdash;but still it doesn&rsquo;t seem as if
&rsquo;twas safe for him over there with those queer folks.
Why, they tell me they don&rsquo;t keep the Fourth o&rsquo;
July!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was privately uneasy for several days; and
it was not until he received Fauntleroy&rsquo;s letter and
had read it several times, both to himself and to Dick,
and had also read the letter Dick got about the same
time, that he became composed again.
</p>

<p>
But they both found great pleasure in their letters.
They read and re-read them, and talked them
over and enjoyed every word of them. And they spent
days over the answers they sent, and read them over
almost as often as the letters they had received.
</p>

<p>
One day they were sitting in the store doorway
together, and Mr. Hobbs was filling his pipe, whilst
Dick told him all about his life and his elder brother,
who had been very good to him after their parents
<a id="pl-82-30"></a>had died. The brother&rsquo;s name was Ben, and he had
managed to get quite a decent place in a store. &ldquo;And
then,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;blest if he didn&rsquo;t go an&rsquo; marry a
<a id="anote-82-33" href="#note-82-33">gal,</a> a regular tiger-cat. She&rsquo;d tear things to pieces,
when she got mad. Had a baby just like her; <a id="anote-82-34" href="#note-82-34">&rsquo;n&rsquo;</a> at
last Ben went out West with a man <a id="anote-82-35" href="#note-82-35">to set up a cattle ranch.&rdquo;</a>
<a id="pl-82-36"></a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He oughtn&rsquo;t to <a id="anote-82-37" href="#note-82-37">&rsquo;ve</a> married,&rdquo; Mr. Hobbs said
solemnly, as he rose to get a match.
</p>

<p>
As he took the match from its box, he stopped
and looked down on the counter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if here isn&rsquo;t a letter! I didn&rsquo;t
<a id="page-83" class="pagenum" title="83"></a>
see it <a id="anote-83-1" href="#note-83-1">afore.</a> The postman must have laid it down when
I wasn&rsquo;t noticin&rsquo;, or the newspaper slipped over it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He picked it up and looked at it carefully.
</p>

<p>
<a id="pl-83-4"></a>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from <em>him</em>!&rdquo; he exclaimed. <a id="anote-83-4" href="#note-83-4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very one it&rsquo;s from!&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
He forgot his pipe altogether. He went back to
his chair quite excited, and took his pocket-knife and
opened the envelope.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what news there is this time,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
And then he unfolded the letter and read as
follows:
</p>

<div class="letter">
<p class="place">
&ldquo;Dorincourt Castle.
</p>

<p class="adr">
&ldquo;My dear Mr. Hobbs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I write this in a great hury becaus i have something <a id="anote-83-14" href="#note-83-14">curous</a>
to tell you i know you will be very mutch suprised my dear frend

shall not have to be an earl there is a lady whitch was marid to

all the things will belong to the other boy i thought at first i
should have to give him my pony and cart but my grandfarther
says i need not my grandfarther is very sorry i am not rich now
becaus when your papa is only the youngest son he is not very
rich i am going to learn to work so that I can take care of dearest
i have been asking Wilkins about grooming horses <a id="anote-83-26" href="#note-83-26">preaps</a> i might

with love from
</p>

<p class="sign">
&ldquo;your old frend<br />
&ldquo;Cedric Errol (Not lord Fauntleroy).&rdquo;
</p>

</div>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs fell back in his chair, the letter dropped
on his knee, his penknife slipped to the floor, and
so did the envelope.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;I am jiggered!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was so dumfounded that he actually changed
his exclamation. It had always been his habit to say,
&ldquo;I <em>will</em> be jiggered,&rdquo; but this time he said, &ldquo;I <em>am</em>
jiggered.&rdquo; Perhaps he really <em>was</em> jiggered. <a id="anote-83-39" href="#note-83-39">There is no knowing.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hobbs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion it&rsquo;s
all <a id="anote-83-42" href="#note-83-42">a put-up job</a> o&rsquo; the British <a id="anote-83-42-2" href="#note-83-42-2">&rsquo;ristycrats</a> to rob him
of his rights because he&rsquo;s an American. They&rsquo;re trying
<a id="page-84" class="pagenum" title="84"></a>
to rob him! that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing, and folks
that have money ought to look after him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And he kept Dick with him until quite a late
hour to talk it over, and when that young man left
he went with him to the corner of the street; and on
his way back he stopped opposite the empty house
for some time, staring at the &ldquo;To Let,&rdquo; and smoking
his pipe in much disturbance of mind.

CHAPTER XII.<br />
THE RIVAL CLAIMANTS.
</h3>

<p>
A very few days after the dinner-party at the
Castle, almost everybody in England who read the
newspaper at all knew the romantic story of what
had happened at Dorincourt. It made a very interesting
story when it was told with all the details.
There was the little American boy who had been
brought to England to be Lord Fauntleroy, and who
was said to be so fine and handsome a little fellow,
and to have already made people fond of him; there
was the old Earl, his grandfather, who was so proud
of his heir; there was the pretty young mother who
had never been forgiven for marrying Captain Errol;
and there was the strange marriage of Bevis the dead
Lord Fauntleroy, and the strange wife, of whom no
one knew anything, suddenly appearing with her son,
and saying that he was the real Lord Fauntleroy and
must have his rights. All these things were talked
about and written about, and caused a tremendous sensation.
And then there came the rumour that the Earl
of Dorincourt was not satisfied with the turn affairs
had taken, and would perhaps contest the claim by
law, and the matter might end with a wonderful trial.
</p>

<p>
There never had been such excitement before in
the county in which Erlesboro was situated. On market-days,
people stood in groups and talked and wondered
what would be done; the farmers&rsquo; wives invited one
another to tea that they might tell one another all
they had heard and all they thought and all they
thought other people thought.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-85" class="pagenum" title="85"></a>
In fact there was excitement everywhere; at the
Castle, in the library, where the Earl and Mr. Havisham
sat and talked; in the servants&rsquo; hall, where Mr.
Thomas and the butler and the other men and women
servants gossiped and <a id="anote-85-5" href="#note-85-5">exclaimed</a> at all times of the
day; and in the stables, where Wilkins went about
his work in a quite depressed state of mind.
</p>

<p>
But in the midst of all the disturbance there was
one person who was quite calm and untroubled. That
person was the little Lord Fauntleroy who was said
not to be Lord Fauntleroy at all. When first the
Earl told him what had happened, he had sat on a
stool <a id="anote-85-13" href="#note-85-13">holding on to his knee,</a> as he so often did when
he was listening to anything interesting; and by the
time the story was finished, he looked quite <a id="anote-85-15" href="#note-85-15">sober.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It makes me feel very queer,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it makes
me&mdash;queer!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl looked at the boy in silence. It made
him feel queer too&mdash;queerer than he had ever felt in
his whole life. And he felt more queer still when he
saw that there was a troubled expression on the small
face which was usually so happy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will they take Dearest&rsquo;s house away from her&mdash;and
her carriage?&rdquo; Cedric asked in a rather unsteady,
anxious little voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>No!</em>&rdquo; said the Earl decidedly&mdash;in quite a loud
voice in fact. &ldquo;They can take nothing from her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Cedric with evident relief. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he looked up at his grandfather, and there
was a wistful shade in his eyes, and they looked very
big and soft.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That other boy,&rdquo; he said rather tremulously&mdash;&ldquo;he
will have to&mdash;to be your boy now&mdash;as I was&mdash;won&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>No!</em>&rdquo; answered the Earl&mdash;and he said it so
fiercely and loudly that Cedric quite <a id="anote-85-37" href="#note-85-37">jumped.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No?&rdquo; he exclaimed, in wonderment. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he?
I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stood up from his stool quite suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I be your boy, even if I&rsquo;m not going to
<a id="page-86" class="pagenum" title="86"></a>
be an earl?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall I be your boy, just as
I was before?&rdquo; And his flushed little face <a id="anote-86-2" href="#note-86-2">was all alight with eagerness.</a>
</p>

<p>
How the old Earl did look at him from head to
foot, to be sure! How his great shaggy brows did
draw themselves together, and how queerly his deep
eyes shone under them&mdash;how very queerly!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; he said &ldquo;yes, you&rsquo;ll be my boy as
long as I live; and, <a id="anote-86-9" href="#note-86-9">by George,</a> sometimes I feel as
if you were the only boy I had ever had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cedric&rsquo;s face turned red to the roots of his hair;
it turned red with relief and pleasure. He put both
his hands deep into his pockets and looked squarely
into his noble relative&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, then, I don&rsquo;t care
about the earl part at all. I don&rsquo;t care whether I&rsquo;m
an earl or not. I thought&mdash;you see, I thought the
one that was going to be the Earl would have to be
your boy too, and&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t be. That was what
made me feel so queer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl put his hand on his shoulder and drew
him nearer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They shall take nothing from you that I can
hold for you,&rdquo; he said, <a id="anote-86-24" href="#note-86-24">drawing his breath hard.</a> &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t believe yet that they can take anything from
you. You were made for the place, and&mdash;well, you
may fill it still. But whatever comes, you shall have
all that I can give you&mdash;all!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It scarcely seemed as if he were speaking to a
child, there was such determination in his face and
voice; it was more as if he were making a promise
to himself&mdash;and perhaps he was.
</p>

<p>
He had never before known <a id="anote-86-33" href="#note-86-33">how deep a hold upon him his fondness for the boy and his pride in him had taken.</a>
He had never seen his strength and good
qualities and beauty as he seemed to see them now.
To his obstinate nature it seemed impossible&mdash;to give
up what he had so set his heart upon. And he had
determined that he would not give it up without a
fierce struggle.
</p>

<p>
Within a few days after she had seen Mr. Havisham,
<a id="page-87" class="pagenum" title="87"></a>
the woman who claimed to be Lady Fauntleroy
presented herself at the Castle, and brought her child
with her. She was sent away. The Earl would not
see her, she was told by the footman at the door; his
lawyer would attend to her cause.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Havisham had noticed, during his interviews
with her, that she was neither so clever nor so bold
as she meant to be. It was as if she had not expected
to meet with such opposition.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is evidently,&rdquo; the lawyer said to Mrs. Errol,
&ldquo;a person from the lower <a id="anote-87-11" href="#note-87-11">walks</a> of life. She is uneducated
and quite unused to meeting people like ourselves
on any terms of equality. She does not know
what to do. Her visit to the Castle quite cowed her.
She was infuriated, but she was cowed. The Earl
would not receive her, but I advised him to go with
me to the Dorincourt Arms, where she is staying.
When she saw him enter the room, she turned white,
though she flew into a rage at once, and threatened
and demanded in one breath.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fact was that the Earl had stalked into the
room and stood, looking like a venerable aristocratic
giant, staring at the woman and not condescending a
word. He let her talk and demand until she was tired,
without himself uttering a word, and then he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You say you are my eldest son&rsquo;s wife. If that
is true, and if the proof you offer is too much for us,
the law is on your side. In that case, your boy is
Lord Fauntleroy. If your claims are proved, you will
be provided for. I want to see nothing either of you
or the child so long as I live.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then he turned his back upon her and stalked
out of the room as he had stalked into it.
</p>

<p>
Not many days after that, a visitor was announced
to Mrs. Errol, who was writing in her little <a id="anote-87-35" href="#note-87-35">morning room.</a>
The maid who brought the message looked
rather excited.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Earl <a id="anote-87-38" href="#note-87-38">hisself,</a> <a id="anote-87-38-2" href="#note-87-38-2">ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</a> she said in tremulous
awe.
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Errol entered the drawing-room, a
very tall, majestic-looking old man was standing on
<a id="page-88" class="pagenum" title="88"></a>
the tiger-skin rug. He had a handsome, grim old face,
with an aquiline profile, a long white moustache, and
an obstinate look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Errol, I believe?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Errol,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am the Earl of Dorincourt,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment, almost unconsciously, to look
into her <a id="anote-88-8" href="#note-88-8">uplifted eyes.</a> They were so like the big,
affectionate, childish eyes he had seen uplifted to his
own so often every day during the last few months,
that they gave him a quite curious sensation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy is very like you,&rdquo; he said abruptly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It has been often said so, my lord,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;but I have been glad to think him like his father
also.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Lady Lorridaile had told him, her voice was
very sweet, and her manner was very simple and
dignified. She did not seem in the least troubled by
his sudden coming.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;he is like&mdash;my son&mdash;too.&rdquo;
He put his hand up to his big white moustache and
pulled it fiercely. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why I
have come here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have seen Mr. Havisham,&rdquo; Mrs. Errol began,
&ldquo;and he has told me of the claims which have been
made&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have come to tell you,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;that
they will be investigated and contested, if a contest
can be made. I have come to tell you that the boy
shall be defended with all the power of the law. His
rights&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The soft voice interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He must have nothing that is <em>not</em> his by right,
even if the law can give it to him,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Unfortunately the law cannot,&rdquo; said the Earl.
&ldquo;If it could, it should. This outrageous woman and
her child&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps she cares for him as much as I care
for Cedric, my lord,&rdquo; said little Mrs. Errol. &ldquo;And
if she was your eldest son&rsquo;s wife, her son is Lord
Fauntleroy, and mine is not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-89" class="pagenum" title="89"></a>
&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;that you would much
prefer that he should not be the Earl of Dorincourt?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her fair young face flushed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a very magnificent thing to be the Earl of
Dorincourt, my lord,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know that, but I
care most that he should be what his father was&mdash;brave
and just and true always.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In striking contrast to what his grandfather was,
eh?&rdquo; said his lordship <a id="anote-89-9" href="#note-89-9">sardonically.</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have not had the pleasure of knowing his
grandfather,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Errol, &ldquo;but I know my little
boy believes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped short a moment, looking
quietly into his face, and then she added, &ldquo;I know
that Cedric loves you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would he have loved me,&rdquo; said the Earl dryly,
&ldquo;if you had told him why I did not receive you at
the Castle?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Errol; &ldquo;I think not. That
was why I did not wish him to know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my lord, brusquely, &ldquo;there are few
women who would not have told him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He suddenly began to walk up and down the
room, pulling his great moustache more violently
than ever.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he is fond of me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I am fond
of him. I can&rsquo;t say I ever was fond of anything before.
I am fond of him. He pleased me from the first.
I am an old man, and was tired of my life. He has
given me something to live for. I am proud of him.
I was satisfied to think of his taking his place some
day as the head of the family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He came back and stood before Mrs. Errol.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am miserable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Miserable!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked as if he was. Even his pride could
not keep his voice steady or his hands from shaking.
For a moment it almost seemed as if his deep, fierce
eyes had tears in them. &ldquo;Perhaps it is because I am
miserable that I have come to you,&rdquo; he said, quite
<a id="anote-89-39" href="#note-89-39">glaring down at her.</a> &ldquo;I used to hate you; I have
been jealous of you. This wretched, disgraceful business
has changed that. I have been an obstinate
<a id="page-90" class="pagenum" title="90"></a>
old fool, and I suppose I have treated you badly.
You are like the boy and the boy is the first object
in my life. I am miserable, and I came to you merely
because you are like the boy, and he cares for you,
and I care for him. Treat me as well as you can,
for the boy&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said it all in his harsh voice, and almost
roughly, but somehow he seemed so broken down for
the time that Mrs. Errol was touched to the heart.
She got up and moved an arm-chair a little forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you would sit down,&rdquo; she said in a soft,
pretty, sympathetic way. &ldquo;You have been so much
troubled that you are very tired, and you need all
your strength.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was just as new to him to be spoken to and
cared for in that gentle, simple way <a id="anote-90-16" href="#note-90-16">as it was to be</a>
contradicted. He was reminded of &ldquo;the boy&rdquo; again,
and he actually did as she asked him. Perhaps his
disappointment and wretchedness were good discipline
for him; if he had not been wretched he might have
continued to hate her, but just at present <a id="anote-90-21" href="#note-90-21">he found her a little soothing.</a>
She had so sweet a face and
voice, and a pretty dignity when she spoke or moved.
Very soon, by the quiet magic of these influences, he
began to feel less gloomy, and then he talked still
more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whatever happens,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the boy shall be
provided for. He shall be taken care of, now and in
the future.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before he went away, he glanced around the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like the house?&rdquo; he demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a cheerful room,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I come
here again and talk this matter over?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As often as you wish, my lord,&rdquo; she replied.
</p>

<p>
And then he went out to his carriage and drove
away, Thomas and Henry <a id="anote-90-37" href="#note-90-37">almost stricken dumb</a> upon
the box at the turn affairs had taken.

CHAPTER XIII.<br />
DICK TO THE RESCUE.
</h3>

<p>
Of course, as soon as the story of Lord Fauntleroy
and the difficulties of the Earl of Dorincourt
were discussed in the English newspapers, they were
discussed in the American newspapers. The story was
too interesting to be passed over lightly, and it was
talked of a great deal. There were so many versions
of it that it would have been an edifying thing to
buy all the papers and compare them. Mr. Hobbs
used to read the papers <a id="anote-91-9" href="#note-91-9">until his head was in a whirl,</a>
and in the evening he and Dick would talk it all over.
They found out what an important personage an Earl
of Dorincourt was, and what a magnificent income he
possessed, and how many estates he owned, and how
stately and beautiful was the Castle in which he lived;
and the more they learned the more excited they
became.
</p>

<p>
<a id="anote-91-17" href="#note-91-17">&ldquo;Seem&rsquo;s like</a> somethin&rsquo; <a id="anote-91-17-2" href="#note-91-17-2">orter</a> be done,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hobbs.
</p>

<p>
But there really was nothing they could do but
each write a letter to Cedric, containing assurances
of their friendship and sympathy. They wrote those
letters as soon as they could after receiving the news.
</p>

<p>
The very next morning, one of Dick&rsquo;s customers
was rather surprised. He was a young lawyer just
beginning practice; as poor as a very young lawyer
can possibly be, but a bright, energetic young fellow,
with sharp wit and a good temper. He had a shabby
office near Dick&rsquo;s stand, and every morning Dick blacked
his boots for him.
</p>

<p>
That particular morning, when he put his foot on
the rest, he had an illustrated paper in his hand&mdash;an
enterprising paper, with pictures in it of conspicuous
people and things. He had just finished looking it
over, and when the last boot was polished, he handed
it to the boy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a paper for you, Dick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Picture
of an English castle in it and an English earl&rsquo;s daughter-in-law.
You ought to become familiar with the nobility
<a id="page-92" class="pagenum" title="92"></a>
and gentry, Dick. Begin on the <a id="anote-92-1" href="#note-92-1">Right Honourable</a> the
Earl of Dorincourt and Lady Fauntleroy. Hello! I
say, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The pictures he spoke of were on the front page,
and Dick was staring at one of them with his eyes
and mouth open, and his sharp face almost pale with
excitement.
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the picture, under which was
written:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother of Claimant (Lord Fauntleroy).&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was the picture of a handsome woman, with
large eyes and heavy braids of black hair wound
around her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her!&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I know her <a id="anote-92-14" href="#note-92-14">better&rsquo;n</a> I know
you! An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve struck work for this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And in less than five minutes from that time he
was tearing through the streets on his way to Mr. Hobbs
and the corner store. Mr. Hobbs could scarcely believe
the evidence of his senses when he looked across the
counter and saw Dick rush in with the paper in his
hand. The boy was out of breath with running; so
much out of breath, in fact, that he could scarcely
speak as he threw the paper down on the counter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at it!&rdquo; panted Dick. &ldquo;Look at that woman
in the picture! That&rsquo;s what you look at! <em>She</em> <a id="anote-92-25" href="#note-92-25">aint</a>
no &rsquo;ristocrat, <em>she</em> aint!&rdquo; with withering scorn. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
no lord&rsquo;s wife. <a id="anote-92-27" href="#note-92-27">You may eat me,</a> if it aint Minna&mdash;<em>Minna!</em>
I&rsquo;d know her <a id="anote-92-28" href="#note-92-28">anywheres,</a> an&rsquo; <a id="anote-92-28-2" href="#note-92-28-2">so&rsquo;d</a> Ben. <a id="anote-92-28-3" href="#note-92-28-3">Jest ax</a>
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs dropped into his seat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <a id="anote-92-31" href="#note-92-31">knowed</a> it was a put-up job,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
knowed it; and <a id="anote-92-32" href="#note-92-32">they done it</a> on account o&rsquo; him bein&rsquo;
a <a id="anote-92-33" href="#note-92-33">&rsquo;Merican!&rdquo;</a>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Done it!&rdquo; cried Dick, with disgust. <a id="anote-92-34" href="#note-92-34">&ldquo;<em>She</em> done</a>
it, that&rsquo;s who done it. <a id="anote-92-35" href="#note-92-35">I&rsquo;ll tell yer wot come to me,</a>
the <a id="anote-92-36" href="#note-92-36">minnit</a> I saw her <a id="anote-92-36-2" href="#note-92-36-2">pictur.</a> There was one <a id="anote-92-36-3" href="#note-92-36-3">o&rsquo; them papers</a>
we saw had a letter in it that said somethin&rsquo;
&rsquo;bout her boy, an&rsquo; it said he had a scar on his
chin. Put them together&mdash;her &rsquo;n&rsquo; that scar! Why
that boy o&rsquo; hers aint no more a lord than I am!
It&rsquo;s <em>Ben&rsquo;s</em> boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-93" class="pagenum" title="93"></a>
Professor Dick Tipton had always been a sharp
boy, and earning his living in the streets of a big
city had made him still sharper. He had learned to
keep his eyes open and his wits about him, and it
mast be confessed he enjoyed immensely the excitement
and impatience of that moment.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs was almost overwhelmed by his sense
of responsibility, and Dick was all alive and full of
energy. He began to write a letter to Ben, and he
cut out the picture and inclosed it to him, and Mr.
Hobbs wrote a letter to Cedric and one to the Earl.
They were in the midst of this letter-writing when
a new idea came to Dick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the <a id="anote-93-14" href="#note-93-14">feller</a> that <a id="anote-93-14-2" href="#note-93-14-2">give</a> me the paper,
he&rsquo;s a lawyer. Let&rsquo;s ax him what we&rsquo;d better do.
Lawyers <a id="anote-93-16" href="#note-93-16">knows</a> it all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hobbs was immensely impressed by this suggestion
and Dick&rsquo;s business capacity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;This here calls for
lawyers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And leaving the store <a id="anote-93-21" href="#note-93-21">in care of</a> a substitute,
<a id="anote-93-22" href="#note-93-22">he struggled into his coat</a> and marched down town with
Dick, and the two presented themselves with their
romantic story in Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s office, much to that
young man&rsquo;s astonishment.
</p>

<p>
If he had not been a very young lawyer, with a
very enterprising mind and a great deal of <a id="anote-93-27" href="#note-93-27">spare</a> time
on his hands, he might not have been so readily interested
in what they had to say, for it all certainly
sounded very wild and queer; but he chanced to want
something to do very much.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Mr. Hobbs, &ldquo;say what your time&rsquo;s
worth an hour and look into this thing thorough, and
<em>I&rsquo;ll</em> pay the damage&mdash;Silas Hobbs, corner of Blank
Street, Vegetables and Groceries.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Harrison, &ldquo;it will be <a id="anote-93-36" href="#note-93-36">a big thing</a>
if it turns out all right, and it will be almost as big
a thing for me as for Lord Fauntleroy; and at any
rate, no harm can be done by investigating. It appears
there has been some dubiousness about the child. The
woman contradicted herself in some of her statements
<a id="page-94" class="pagenum" title="94"></a>
about his age, and aroused suspicion. The first persons
to be written to are Dick&rsquo;s brother and the Earl of
Dorincourt&rsquo;s family lawyer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And actually before the sun went down, two
letters had been written and sent in two different
directions&mdash;one speeding out of New York harbour on
a mail steamer on its way to England, and the other
on a train carrying letters and passengers bound for
California. And the first was addressed to T. Havisham,
<a id="anote-94-10" href="#note-94-10">Esq.,</a> and the second to Benjamin Tipton.
</p>

<p>
And after the store was closed that evening, Mr.
Hobbs and Dick sat in the back room and talked
together until midnight.

CHAPTER XIV.<br />
THE EXPOSURE.
</h3>

<p>
It is astonishing how short a time it takes for
very wonderful things to happen. It had taken only
a few minutes, apparently, to change all the fortunes
of the little boy dangling his red legs from the high
stool in Mr. Hobbs&rsquo;s store, and to transform him from
a small boy, living the simplest life in a quiet street,
into an English nobleman, the heir to an earldom and
magnificent wealth. It had taken only a few minutes,
apparently, to change him from an English nobleman
into a penniless little impostor, with no right to any
of the splendours he had been enjoying. And, surprising
as it may appear, it did not take nearly so
long a time as one might have expected to alter the
face of everything again and to give back to him all
that he had been in danger of losing.
</p>

<p>
It took the less time because, after all, the woman
who had called herself Lady Fauntleroy was not nearly
so clever as she was wicked; and when she had been
closely pressed by Mr. Havisham&rsquo;s questions about her
marriage and her boy, she had made one or two blunders
which had caused suspicion to be awakened; and then
she had lost her presence of mind and her temper,
and in her excitement and anger had betrayed herself
still further. There seemed no doubt that she had
<a id="page-95" class="pagenum" title="95"></a>
been married to Bevis, Lord Fauntleroy, but Mr. Havisham
found out that her story of the boy&rsquo;s being born
in a certain part of London was false; and just when
they all were in the midst of the commotion caused
by this discovery, there came the letter from the young
lawyer in New York, and Mr. Hobbs&rsquo;s letters also.
</p>

<p>
What an evening it was when those letters arrived,
and when Mr. Havisham and the Earl sat and
talked their plans over in the library!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After my first three meetings with her,&rdquo; said
Mr. Havisham, &ldquo;I began to suspect her strongly. Our
best plan will be <a id="anote-95-12" href="#note-95-12">to cable</a> at once for these two Tiptons,
say nothing about them to her, and suddenly confront
her with them when she is not expecting it. My
opinion is that she will betray herself on the spot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And that was what actually happened. She was told
nothing, but one fine morning, as she sat in her sitting-room
at the inn called &ldquo;The Dorincourt Arms,&rdquo; making
some very fine plans for herself, Mr. Havisham was
announced; and when he entered, he was followed by
no leas than three persons&mdash;one was a <a id="anote-95-21" href="#note-95-21">sharp-faced</a> boy
and one was a big young man, and the third was the
Earl of Dorincourt.
</p>

<p>
She sprang to her feet and actually uttered a cry
of terror. She had thought of these new-comers as
being thousands of miles away, when she had ever
thought of them at all, which she had scarcely done
for years. She had never expected to see them again.
It must be confessed that Dick grinned a little when
he saw her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello, Minna!&rdquo; he said,
</p>

<p>
The big young man&mdash;who was Ben&mdash;stood still a
minute and looked at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo; Mr. Havisham asked, glancing
from one to the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;I know her and she knows me.
<a id="anote-95-37" href="#note-95-37">I can swear to her</a> in any court, and I can bring
a dozen others who will. Her father is a respectable
sort of man, and he&rsquo;s honest enough to be ashamed
of her. He&rsquo;ll tell you who she is, and whether she
married me or not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-96" class="pagenum" title="96"></a>
Then he clenched his hand suddenly and turned
on her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the child?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going
with me! <a id="anote-96-4" href="#note-96-4">He is done with you,</a> and so am I!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And just as he finished saying the words, the
door leading into the bedroom opened a little, and the
boy, probably attracted by the sound of the loud voices,
looked in. He was not a handsome boy, but he had
rather a nice face, and he was quite like Ben, his
father, as any one could see, and there was the three-cornered
scar on his chin.
</p>

<p>
Ben walked up to him and took his hand, and
his own was trembling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; he said to the little fellow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your
father; I&rsquo;ve come to take you away. Where&rsquo;s your
hat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy pointed to where it lay on a chair. It
evidently rather pleased him to hear that he was
going away. Ben took up the hat and marched to the
door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you want me again,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Havisham,
&ldquo;you know where to find me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He walked out of the room, holding the child&rsquo;s
hand and not looking at the woman once. She was
<a id="anote-96-25" href="#note-96-25">fairly</a> raving with fury, and the Earl was calmly
gazing at her through his eyeglasses, which he had
quietly placed upon his aristocratic eagle nose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, my young woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Havisham.
&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do at all. If you don&rsquo;t want to
be locked up, you really must behave yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And there was something so very business-like
in his tones that, probably feeling that the safest
thing she could do would be to get out of the way,
she gave him one savage look and <a id="anote-96-34" href="#note-96-34">dashed past him</a>
into the next room and slammed the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall have no more trouble with her,&rdquo; said
Mr. Havisham.
</p>

<p>
And he was right; for that very night she left
the Dorincourt Arms and took the train to London,
and was seen no more.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-97" class="pagenum" title="97"></a>
When the Earl left the room after the interview,
he went at once to his carriage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To Court Lodge,&rdquo; he said to Thomas.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To Court Lodge,&rdquo; said Thomas to the coachman
as he mounted the box; &ldquo;an&rsquo; you may depend on it,
things <a id="anote-97-6" href="#note-97-6">is</a> taking a <a id="anote-97-6-2" href="#note-97-6-2">uniggspected</a> turn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When the carriage stopped at Court Lodge, Cedric
was in the drawing-room with his mother.
</p>

<p>
The Earl came in without being announced. He
looked an inch or so taller, and a great many years
younger. His deep eyes flashed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is Lord Fauntleroy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Errol came forward, a flush rising to her
cheek.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it Lord Fauntleroy?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is it, indeed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl put out his hand and grasped hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he put his other hand on Cedric&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fauntleroy,&rdquo; he said in his unceremonious, authoritative
way, &ldquo;ask your mother when she will come to
us at the Castle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy flung his arms around his mother&rsquo;s neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To live with us!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;To live with us
always!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Earl looked at Mrs. Errol, and Mrs. Errol
looked at the Earl. His lordship was entirely in
earnest. He had made up his mind to waste no time
in arranging this matter. He had begun to think
it would suit him to make friends with his heir&rsquo;s
mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you quite sure you want me?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Errol, with her soft, pretty smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; he said bluntly. &ldquo;We have always
wanted you, but we were not exactly aware of it.
We hope you will come.&rdquo;
</p>

CHAPTER XV.<br />
HIS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY.
</h3>

<p>
Ben took his boy and went back to his cattle
<a id="anote-98-2" href="#note-98-2">ranch</a> in California, and he returned under very comfortable
circumstances. Just before his going, Mr.
Havisham had an interview with him in which the
lawyer told him that the Earl of Dorincourt wished
to do something for the boy who might have turned
out to be Lord Fauntleroy. And so when Ben went
away, he went as the <a id="anote-98-8" href="#note-98-8">prospective</a> master of a ranch
which would be almost as good as his own, and might
easily become his own in time, as indeed it did in
the course of a few years; and Tom, the boy, grew
up on it into a fine young man and was <a id="anote-98-12" href="#note-98-12">devotedly fond of</a>
his father; and they were so successful and
happy that Ben used to say that Tom <a id="anote-98-14" href="#note-98-14">made up to him</a>
for all the troubles he had ever had.
</p>

<p>
But Dick and Mr. Hobbs&mdash;who had actually come
over with the others to see that things were properly
looked after&mdash;did not return for some time. It had
been decided at the outset that the Earl would provide
for Dick, and would see that he received a solid education;
and Mr. Hobbs had decided that as he himself
had left a reliable substitute in charge of his store,
he could afford to wait to see the festivities which
were to celebrate Lord Fauntleroy&rsquo;s eighth birthday.
All the tenantry were invited, and there were to be
feasting and dancing and games in the park, and bonfires
and fireworks in the evening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just like the Fourth of July!&rdquo; said Lord Fauntleroy.
&ldquo;It seems a pity my birthday wasn&rsquo;t on the
Fourth, doesn&rsquo;t it? For then we could keep them
both together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What a grand day it was when little Lord Fauntleroy&rsquo;s
birthday arrived, and how his young lordship
enjoyed it! How beautiful the park looked, filled
with the thronging people dressed in their gayest and
best, and with the flags flying from the tents and the
top of the Castle! Nobody had stayed away who
could possibly come, because everybody was really
<a id="page-99" class="pagenum" title="99"></a>
glad that little Lord Fauntleroy was to be little Lord
Fauntleroy still, and some day was to be the master
of everything. Every one wanted to have a look at
him, and at his pretty, kind mother, who had made
so many friends.
</p>

<p>
What scores and scores of people there were under
the trees, and in the tents, and on the lawns! Farmers
and farmers&rsquo; wives in their Sunday suits and bonnets
and shawls; children frolicking and chasing about;
and old dames in red cloaks gossiping together. At
the Castle, there were ladies and gentlemen who had
come to see the fun, and to congratulate the Earl,
and to meet Mrs. Errol. Lady Lorridaile and Sir
Harry were there, and Mr. Havisham, of course.
</p>

<p>
Everybody looked after little Lord Fauntleroy.
And the sun shone and the flags fluttered and the
games were played and the dances danced, and as
the gaieties went on and the joyous afternoon passed,
his little lordship <a id="anote-99-19" href="#note-99-19">was simply radiantly happy.</a>
</p>

<p>
The whole world seemed beautiful to him.
</p>

<p>
There was some one else who was happy too,&mdash;an
old man, who, though he had been rich and noble
all his life, had not often been very honestly happy.
Perhaps, indeed, I shall tell you that I think it was
because he was rather better than he had been that
he was rather happier. He had not, indeed, suddenly
become as good as Fauntleroy thought him; but, at least,
he had begun to love something, and he had several
times found a sort of pleasure in doing the kind things
which the innocent, kind little heart of a child had
suggested,&mdash;and that was a beginning. And every day
he had been more pleased with his son&rsquo;s wife. He
liked to hear her sweet voice and to see her sweet
face; and as she sat in his arm-chair, he used to watch
her and listen as he talked to her boy; and he heard
loving, gentle words which were new to him, and he
began to see why the little fellow who had lived in
a New York side street and known grocery-men and
made friends with boot-blacks, was still so well-bred
and manly a little fellow that he made no one ashamed
<a id="page-100" class="pagenum" title="100"></a>
of him, even when fortune changed him into the heir
to an English earldom, living in an English castle.
</p>

<p>
As the old Earl of Dorincourt looked at him that
day, moving about the park among the people, talking
to those he knew and making his ready little bow
when any one greeted him, entertaining his friends
Dick and Mr. Hobbs, or standing near his mother
listening to their conversation, the old nobleman was
very well satisfied with him. And he had never been
better satisfied than he was when they went down to
the biggest tent, where the more important tenants of
the Dorincourt estate were sitting down to the grand
collation of the day.
</p>

<p>
They were drinking toasts; and, after they had
drunk the health of the Earl with much more enthusiasm
than his name had ever been greeted with before, they
proposed the health of &ldquo;Little Lord Fauntleroy.&rdquo; And
if there had ever been any doubt at all as to whether
his lordship was popular or not, it would have been
<a id="anote-100-20" href="#note-100-20">settled</a> that instant. Such a clamour of voices and
such a rattle of glasses and applause!
</p>

<p>
Little Lord Fauntleroy was delighted. He stood
and smiled, and made bows, and <a id="anote-100-23" href="#note-100-23">flushed rosy red</a> with
pleasure up to the roots of his bright hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it because they like me, Dearest?&rdquo; he said
to his mother. &ldquo;Is it Dearest? I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then the Earl put his hand on the child&rsquo;s
shoulder and said to him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fauntleroy, say to them that you thank them
for their kindness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fauntleroy gave a glance up at him and then at
his mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Must I?&rdquo; he asked just a trifle shyly, and she
smiled, and nodded. And so he made a little step
forward, and everybody looked at him&mdash;such a beautiful,
innocent little fellow he was, too, with his brave,
trustful face!&mdash;and he spoke as loudly as he could,
his childish voice ringing out quite clear and strong.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ever so much obliged to you!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and&mdash;I
hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy my birthday&mdash;because I&rsquo;ve enjoyed
it so much&mdash;and&mdash;I&rsquo;m very glad I&rsquo;m going to
<a id="page-101" class="pagenum" title="101"></a>
be an earl&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think at first I should like it,
but now I do&mdash;and I love this place so, and I think
it is beautiful&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;and when I am an earl, I
am going to try to be as good as my grandfather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And amid the shouts and clamour of applause, he
stepped back with a little sigh of relief, and put his
hand into the Earl&rsquo;s and stood close to him, smiling
and leaning against his side.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
And that would be the very end of my story;
but I must add one curious piece of information,
which is that Mr. Hobbs became so fascinated with
high life and was so reluctant to leave his young
friend that he actually sold his corner store in New
York, and settled in the English village of Erlesboro,
where he opened a shop which was patronized by the
Castle and consequently was a great success. And
about ten years after, when Dick, who had finished
his education and was going to visit his brother in
California, asked the good grocer if he did not wish
to return to America, he shook his head seriously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not to live there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not to live there;
I want to be near <em>him</em>. It&rsquo;s a good enough country
for them <a id="anote-101-23" href="#note-101-23">that&rsquo;s</a> young an <a id="anote-101-23-2" href="#note-101-23-2">stirrin&rsquo;</a>&mdash;but there&rsquo;s faults
in it. There&rsquo;s not an <a id="anote-101-25" href="#note-101-25">auntsister</a> among &rsquo;em&mdash;nor an earl!&rdquo;

<p class="noindent">
Es wird ein Quadrat abgesteckt, welches <span class="gesperrt">diamond</span> (Raute
oder carreau) heißt und dessen Seiten je 90 Fuß lang
sind. An den Ecken sind die <span class="gesperrt">bases</span> (Male), welche
<a id="page-105" class="pagenum" title="105"></a>
<span class="gesperrt">home</span> (Ziel) oder <span class="gesperrt">home base</span> <em>[H]</em>, <span class="gesperrt">first
base</span> <em>[I]</em>, <span class="gesperrt">second base</span> <em>[II]</em> und <span class="gesperrt">third
base</span> <em>[III]</em> heißen. Die Spieler stellen
sich um das Quadrat herum auf. Hinter <em>H</em>
steht der <span class="gesperrt">catcher</span> (Fänger) <em>[C]</em>; der
<span class="gesperrt">pitcher</span> (Werfer) <em>[P]</em> steht auf der Linie
<em>H II</em> 50 Fuß von <em>H</em> entfernt; die drei
<span class="gesperrt">basemen</span> (Malmänner) stehen neben <em>I</em>,
<em>II</em>, <em>III</em>. Der <span class="gesperrt">shortstop</span> <em>[S]</em> (Aufhalter)
steht zwischen <em>II</em> und <em>III</em>. Ferner stehen
noch 3 <span class="gesperrt">fielders</span> d. h. Mitglieder der
nicht an der Reihe befindlichen Partei
<em>R</em> (right fielder), &#8857; (centre fielder), <em>L</em> (left
fielder) in einiger Entfernung hinter und auf beiden Seiten von <em>II</em>. Der
<span class="gesperrt">pitcher</span> wirft den Ball über das <span class="gesperrt">home</span> dem <span class="gesperrt">catcher</span> zu, während
ein Mann der Partei, welche in (= am Spiel) oder <span class="gesperrt">at the bat</span> (= am
Schlagholz) ist, neben dem <span class="gesperrt">home</span> steht und den vom <span class="gesperrt">pitcher</span> geworfenen
Ball, ehe er zum <span class="gesperrt">catcher</span> gelangt, mit seinem Schlagholz
zu treffen sucht. Schlägt er denselben in die Luft und fängt
ihn einer der Gegenpartei auf, bevor er zu Boden fällt, so ist
der Schlagende <span class="gesperrt">out</span> oder <span class="gesperrt">caught out</span> (d. h. er muß den Schlägel
einem andern Spieler seiner Partei abtreten). Fällt der geschlagene
Ball außerhalb der Linien <em>H I</em> oder <em>H III</em> oder ihrer
Verlängerung, z. B. nach <em>X</em> oder <em>Y</em>, so ist der Schlag <span class="gesperrt">foul</span> (ungültig)
und wird nicht gezählt, außer wenn der Ball vor dem
Niederfallen aufgefangen wird, worauf der <span class="gesperrt">striker</span> oder <span class="gesperrt">batter</span>
ebenfalls <span class="gesperrt">out</span> wird. Wird aber der Ball innerhalb der genannten
Linien d. h. in den <span class="gesperrt">diamond</span> geschlagen, so muß der Schläger
zunächst nach <em>I</em>, dann der Reihe nach über <em>II</em> und <em>III</em> nach <em>H</em>
zurücklaufen. Gelingt ihm dies, so wird ihm ein <em>run</em> (Lauf) angerechnet.
Wird aber der Ball von einem bei <em>I</em> stehenden Spieler
aufgefangen, bevor der Schläger dahin gelangt, oder wird dieser
während seines Laufes von einem Gegner mit dem Ball berührt,
so ist der Schläger <span class="gesperrt">out</span>. Sind drei Schläger derselben Partei
<span class="gesperrt">out</span> gemacht, so ist ein <span class="gesperrt">inning</span> (Reihe) vorüber und die Gegenpartei
kommt an die Reihe. Das Spiel besteht aus 9 <span class="gesperrt">innings</span>
für jede Partei, und jene Partei hat gewonnen, welche innerhalb
ihrer <span class="gesperrt">innings</span> die meisten <span class="gesperrt">runs</span> gemacht hat. &mdash; <a id="note-42-14" href="#anote-42-14">14. <em>I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t</em>,</a>

erscheint seit dem 1. Oktober 1883; sie ist eine Sammlung der besten
französischen und englischen Schriftsteller vom 17. bezw. 16. Jahrhundert
an bis in die neueste Zeit.
</p>

<p>
Bezüglich der äußeren Ausstattung sei folgendes bemerkt:
</p>

<p>
a) Die <em>Schrift</em> entspricht <em>allen von medizinisch-pädagogischen
Vereinen gestellten Anforderungen</em>; sie ist groß,
scharf und deutlich lesbar wegen des richtigen Verhältnisses
zwischen Höhe der großen und kleinen Buchstaben unter sich und
zwischen Buchstabenhöhe und Entfernung der einzelnen Zeilen.
<em>Selbst schwache Augen dürften lange Zeit ohne Ermüdung
diese Schrift lesen können.</em>
</p>

<p>
b) Das <em>Papier</em> ist ein eigens hierzu angefertigter, kräftiger,
nicht durchscheinender, guter Stoff von gelblicher Färbung, <em>die
sehr wohltuend auf das Auge des Schülers wirkt</em>.
</p>

<p>
c) Der <em>Einband ist biegsam und dauerhaft</em>.

<p>
Die &bdquo;<b>Französische und Englische Schulbibliothek</b>&ldquo;, aufgebaut
auf den Thesen der Direktoren-Versammlung in der Provinz Hannover
(1882), ist den Anforderungen <em>der Lehrpläne und Lehraufgaben
für die höheren Schulen vom Jahre 1901 genau angepaßt</em>.
Sie bringt nicht nur die wichtigeren Schriftwerke der letzten drei
bezw. vier Jahrhunderte und führt somit in die Literatur, Kultur-
und Volkskunde der beiden großen Kulturvölker ein (Lehrpläne
und Lehraufgaben von 1901, S. 37 u. 38), sondern sie berücksichtigt
auch die <span class="gesperrt">technisch-wissenschaftliche Lektüre</span> und wird so
<span class="gesperrt">den weitgehendsten Forderungen der Gymnasien und
Realanstalten</span> gerecht.
</p>

<p>
Folgende Grundsätze sind für die Gestaltung derselben maßgebend.
</p>

<p>
1. <em>Die Schulbibliothek</em> bringt <em>Prosa</em> und <em>Poesie</em>. Die <em>Prosa</em>bände
enthalten den Lesestoff für je ein <em>Halbjahr</em>. Mit Ausnahme
<em>der Lebensbeschreibungen</em> berühmter Männer, welche, <em>ohne
Beeinträchtigung des Gesamtbildes</em>, zweckentsprechend gekürzt
erscheinen, <em>werden nur Teile eines Ganzen veröffentlicht,
die, in sich aber eine Art Ganzes bildend</em>, eine hinreichende
Bekanntschaft mit den Geisteswerken und deren Verfassern ermöglichen.
</p>

<p>
2. Vor <em>jedem</em> Bande erscheint eine dem Gesichtskreis des Schülers
entsprechende <em>Lebensbeschreibung</em> des Schriftstellers sowie eine
kurze Zusammenstellung <em>alles dessen, was zu seinem vollen
Verständnis zu wissen nötig scheint</em>. Den <em>poetischen</em> Bänden
gehen außerdem eine <em>metrische</em> und eine <em>sprachliche</em> Einleitung
voran, die sich streng an das betreffende Stück anlehnen.
</p>

<p>
3. Der <em>Text</em> ist bei den <em>Prosaikern</em> der Übersichtlichkeit halber
in kürzere Kapitel geteilt.
</p>

<p>
4. Der <em>Rechtschreibung</em> in den <em>französischen</em> Bänden liegt die
Ausgabe des <em>Dictionnaire de l&rsquo;Académie</em> von <em>1877</em> zugrunde.
</p>

<p>
5. Die <em>Anmerkungen</em> sind <em>deutsch</em>; sie stehen von Band <em>100</em>
an und in den neuen Auflagen früher erschienener Bände <em>hinter</em>
dem Texte. Bei Bänden, von denen auch oder nur <em>einsprachige
Ausgaben</em> (französisch bezw. englisch) erschienen sind, ist dies
im Verzeichnis besonders angegeben.
</p>

<p>
6. Die sachliche <em>Erklärung</em> bringt das <em>Notwendige</em> ohne <em>gelehrtes</em>
Beiwerk. <em>Sprachliche Anmerkungen</em> finden sich da, wo eine
Eigenheit in der Ausdrucksweise des Schriftstellers vorliegt; die
<em>Grammatik</em> wird nur ganz <em>ausnahmsweise</em> behandelt, wenn sich
die Schwierigkeit einer Stelle durch die nicht leicht bemerkbare
Unterordnung unter eine grammatische Regel heben läßt. Auf eine
bestimmte Grammatik ist nicht hingewiesen. Die <em>Synonymik</em> ist
<em>nicht</em> berücksichtigt. <em>Soll dieselbe ihren Zweck als formales
Bildungsmittel nicht verfehlen, so muß da, wo das Verständnis
des Textes und die Wahl des richtigen Ausdrucks selbst
eine synonymische Aufklärung erheischen, diese gemeinschaftlich
von den Schülern gesucht und unter der unmittelbaren
Einwirkung des Lehrers gefunden werden.</em> Aus <em>gleichen</em> Gründen
ist der <em>Etymologie kein Platz</em> eingeräumt.
</p>

<p>
7. <em>Übersetzungen</em>, die nur der <em>Trägheit</em> des Schülers Vorschub
leisten, sind ausgeschlossen. &mdash; Die Herausgabe von <em>Sonderwörterbüchern</em>
zu einzelnen Bänden hat sich als eine <em>zwingende Notwendigkeit</em>
erwiesen; denn abgesehen davon, daß die Konkurrenzunternehmungen
derartige Wörterbücher veröffentlichen, welche
die Schüler <em>auf jeden Fall</em> sich zu verschaffen wissen, sind auch
an die Schriftleitung seitens zahlreicher Amtsgenossen Zuschriften
gelangt, denen zufolge die namentlich für die <em>mittleren</em> Klassen
bestimmten Ausgaben nur <em>mit einem Wörterbuche</em> in Gebrauch
genommen werden können, weil <em>erst in den oberen Klassen</em> auf
die Anschaffung eines Schulwörterbuches <em>gedrungen</em> wird. Da
<em>jedoch die Wörterbücher den betreffenden Bänden nicht beigegeben
sind, sondern erst auf Verlangen nachgeliefert werden,
so bedarf es nur eines Antrages seitens der Schule, wenn das
Sonderwörterbuch nicht geliefert werden soll</em>.
</p>

<p>
8. <em>Aussprachebezeichnungen</em> werden hinzugefügt, wo die Schulwörterbücher
den <a id="corr-15"></a>Schüler im Stiche lassen; <em>sie fehlen</em> bei den
<em>seltener</em> vorkommenden <em>ausländischen Eigennamen</em>, weil die
<em>gebildeten Engländer und Franzosen</em> bemüht sind, <em>dieselben so
auszusprechen, wie sie im Lande selbst ausgesprochen werden</em>.
</p>

<p>
9. Den <em>geschichtlichen</em> Stoffen sind <em>Abbildungen</em>, <em>Karten</em> und
<em>Pläne</em> beigegeben; <em>Verzeichnisse</em> zu den Anmerkungen erleichtern
das Zurechtfinden in einzelnen Bänden. &mdash;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
